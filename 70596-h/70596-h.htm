<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_CRUSADE_THAT_WENT_ASTRAY">A CRUSADE THAT WENT ASTRAY</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">More than 750 years ago—the exact date was May 24, 1203—a
mighty and crowded armada sailed away from the beautiful
island of Corfu just off the northwest corner of Greece.</p>

<p>It headed southward toward a brilliant blue sea.</p>

<p>The weather was balmy. The myrtle was in bloom. The
leaves on the twisted gray olive trees flashed silver. The sky
was fine and clear. The wind was gentle and favorable. Indeed,
it barely ruffled the water. But it filled hundreds and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
hundreds of sails of every possible color. Red sails. Golden
sails. Lavender sails. Green sails. Orange sails. And sails of a
wonderful bright yellow. Even Geoffrey of Villehardouin, a
bold French baron and famous historian who was one of the
passengers, could not say how many they were. But he did
know that they took his breath away.</p>

<p>“I, Geoffrey,” he scratched out slowly, “to my knowledge
have not ever lied by one word, and I bear witness that never
was yet seen so fair a sight. As far as the eye could reach,
there was no space without sails, and ships, and vessels.”</p>

<p>Certainly there were enough ships to cover miles of ocean.
Flat, broad-beamed palanders, built especially to carry
troops and horses—the 4,500 knights with their fiery steeds,
the 9,000 esquires, and the 20,000 foot soldiers who made up
the expedition.</p>

<p>Swift galleys to protect the mighty convoy. These galleys
had oars as well as sails, and they lashed the waters to foam
as they hurried about their tasks. There were even some fat,
slow merchant vessels. Just as it is today, business was business
in the Middle Ages, even when you went to war.</p>

<p>But business or no business, the men crowding the rails
were carried forward by another, nobler purpose. And before
each of them had left his drafty castle in Normandy or France
or Italy, he had sworn this solemn oath: “I will put on the
cross, and march to redeem the land where Jesus lived, and
where He died for us.”</p>

<p>Once before it had been redeemed by Godfrey of Bouillon
and the other saints and heroes of the First Crusade. But
then the famous Arab leader Saladin had won it back, and
not even Richard the Lion-Hearted, the knightly king of England,
could defeat Saladin.</p>

<p>“We will succeed where Richard failed. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus vult!</i> God
wills it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>The crusaders had a plan. Instead of landing on the
enemy-held beaches of Palestine, they would sail to Egypt
and fight their way across the desert and up through the
famous Gaza strip, about which we read even today, to Jerusalem.
The back door would be easier than the front door.
They could not fail.</p>

<p>Their hearts, therefore, were high as they sailed along the
rugged coast with its deep inlets and its violet mountains—past
rocky Ithaca, the legendary home of the wily Ulysses;
past yellow beaches where the ancient Greeks drew up their
craft before they sailed to rescue Helen of Troy; finally, past
the southernmost tip of Greece where the storms were supposed
to meet. Then suddenly something happened. Instead
of continuing toward the Holy Land, the mighty fleet altered
its course and turned north. What possibly could be the reason?
The leaders knew, but most of the fighting men were
puzzled.</p>

<p>Soon a whisper ran from lip to lip. There was a new destination.
Constantinople the Golden—the fabled Byzantium!
The capital of the Greek, or Eastern Roman, Empire! The
legendary El Dorado city with its glitter and its glory which
was set on the Bosporus, a narrow little body of water that
divides Europe from Asia, separating the West from the East.</p>

<p>It was the tough old doge of Venice who had changed the
crusaders’ minds for them. Henry Dandolo was eighty years
old and blind, but he knew that ducats did not grow on trees,
and he was just as eager to get back the money he had loaned
them as any Venetian merchant over whom he ruled. The crusaders
had promised to give the Venetians four silver marks
for each man and two silver marks for each horse that they
transported to the East, but now after months of borrowing
and begging and promising instead of paying, they still owed
them 34,000 marks. What could be done about it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Facing the knights and barons in the great, glittering
church of Saint Mark, the old doge stroked his white beard
and had an answer. “You are fighting men. Pay us back with
fighting. The king of Hungary has taken Zara from us. Take it
back again and give it to us.”</p>

<p>They did, but even then the Venetians were not satisfied.</p>

<p>“There is a richer prize ahead. Win us Constantinople.
Capture <em>it</em> for us, and we will really call quits.”</p>

<p>The leaders agreed. The Holy Land would have to wait a
while to be redeemed.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to exaggerate the excitement of the
crusaders when they heard the magic name of Constantinople.
For they all knew about the fabulous city. Minstrels told about
it in the long sagas they sang before huge crackling fires on
winter nights. They spoke of its shining metal towers and
called it Micklegarth, or Bigtown.</p>

<p>Its fame was also spread throughout the West by Russian
traders. In those days, the Russians were like the vikings who
roved the oceans from America to the Greek Sea. They had
enslaved the backward Slavic tribes of Kiev and Moscow
and once a year, when the ice melted, these snub-nosed,
green-eyed marauders made their vassals cut down huge trees
and hollow them into boats. Aboard these, they floated down
the great rivers, and then sailed across the foggy Black Sea
and up the Bosporus until they reached the enormous city,
the biggest they had ever seen. There they traded honey and
marten skins and dried fish and even caviar for pepper and
brocades and carved ivory and delicate enamels. These Russians,
too, were dazzled by Constantinople and had their own
name for it. They called it Tsargrad, or Caesar City.</p>

<p>But long before there were Russians or any other kind of
vikings, the city had amazed our ancestors. “I see before my
eyes something I had often heard about but would never believe!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
exclaimed Athanaric, a guttural-speaking king from
the forests of Germany. “Look at the walls. Look at the buildings,
look at the harbor filled with ships! Look at the men of
every nation crowding the alleys and bazaars. Look at the
disciplined soldiers! Surely God himself must be the emperor!”
said Athanaric.</p>

<p>The mighty Charlemagne, who had been crowned emperor
of the West, once sent an embassy to Constantinople to discuss
the possibility of marrying the Byzantine empress Irene.
Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela, a learned Spanish Jew, was astonished
at its splendor. It was richer, he said, than any other
city in the world. Why, the ordinary merchant wore garments
of silk ornamented with gold and precious stones! He rode
about his business on horseback as a prince does!</p>

<p>It was the city of Justinian, the great lawgiver, whose book
of laws was still studied in the crusaders’ own cities of Paris
and Bologna 700 years after his reign.</p>

<p>Only the wisest of them knew that he was much more than
a lawgiver. A tall towheaded country boy from what is modern
Yugoslavia, he was more than just one of the great Byzantine
emperors. He was one of the great rulers of all time. It was
his generals who reconquered Africa, Italy, and parts of Spain,
and almost restored the ancient Roman Empire. It was he who
ordered the most famous architects of the time to build the
church of Santa Sophia. Most of the finest Byzantine mosaics
were done during his reign, and the Orthodox Christian
Church was first firmly established then. The Age of Justinian
was the first great age of the Byzantine Empire when its
power affected the whole Mediterranean world.</p>

<p>It was the city of great soldiers like the cruel Basil the Bulgar
Slayer, who had cold-bloodedly blinded 15,000 of his
Bulgarian enemies, but who had permanently broken the
power of these wild raiders; like John Kercuas, an Asia Minor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Napoleon; and like Nicephorus Phocas, who had rolled back
the Arabs, the deadliest foes of the Byzantines, whether they
fought on camel back or on a warship at sea.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="18-19" style="max-width: 94.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/18-19.jpg" alt="Man standing in boat">
</figure>
<br>

<p>It was the city of foxy Alexius Comnenus, and his dark-eyed
daughter, Anna, who wrote even better histories than
Villehardouin.</p>

<p>The crusaders knew about <em>him</em>! By his quick thinking and
crafty talking this same Alexius, Emperor Alexius I, had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
only persuaded their grandsires and great-grandsires of an
earlier crusade to stay out of Constantinople, but he had also
talked them into fighting the Turks for him. He had even
talked some of them into becoming his vassals. He had received
the leaders in the Sacred Palace, however, and they
told the other barons what they saw there. From then on
Constantinople was a city of marvels to the men of the Middle
Ages. They also began to covet its wealth.</p>

<p>To be sure, not all the crusaders were happy at the thought
of attacking another Christian city, especially when they remembered
how angry the Pope had been at the taking of
Zara, also a Christian city. But the doge of Venice had an
answer for every objection.</p>

<p>The Byzantines, the people of Constantinople, were not
really true Christians at all, he said. They were heretics.</p>

<p>The crusaders were not conquering Constantinople; they
were restoring it to its rightful ruler. On board was the young
Alexius, who ought to sit on the throne as Alexius IV. Alexius
was a worthless young man, but his father had been emperor
until he was deposed and blinded by his own brother.</p>

<p>Besides that, how could the crusaders pay back Venice all
they owed her if they did not take Constantinople?</p>

<p>The young Alexius not only promised that he would settle
all their debts if they took the city for him, but that he would
give them enough money to go on to their destination. He
said that he would ride with them at the head of a Byzantine
army of 10,000 soldiers. He promised that as long as he lived
he would equip and maintain out of his own treasury 500 of
their knights.</p>

<p>A majority of the brave knights were convinced by these
arguments and by the thought of all the fighting men and
gold. Among them was Geoffrey of Villehardouin who tells
us most of what we know about the Fourth Crusade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>It took almost a month to make the voyage. After the crusaders
rounded the tip of Greece, they sailed past the remains
of ancient Sparta, past Athens, and at the island of Andros
they stopped for water. A little later, they drifted past the
site of the ancient town of Troy. Finally, they touched at
Abydos on the historic Dardanelles, where they raided the
countryside and filled their holds with grain. “Great was the
need thereof!” muttered Geoffrey.</p>

<p>On June 23, 1203, they dropped anchor within sight of
Constantinople. The snow-covered Thracian mountains lay
to the west, and grape-colored Asia Minor to starboard. “And
be it known to you,” scratched out Villehardouin, his pulses
beating, “that no man among us was so hardy that he did
not tremble.” For in every direction, there was nothing but
high walls and towers and rich palaces and mighty churches.</p>

<p>The next morning banners and pennants were flown from
the castles of every ship. The coverings were taken from the
shields. The bulwarks were made ready for action. Then the
sailors weighed anchor and spread sails to the wind.</p>

<p>“Thus we passed before Constantinople and so near that
we shot at their vessels. There were so many people on the
walls and towers that it seemed as if there could be no more
people in the world.”</p>

<p>Four weeks later the city was in their hands, and although
Geoffrey and his fellow crusaders did not realize it, this event
marked a turning point in history. For 900 years Constantinople
had stood proudly and safe, ruling her empire and giving
orders like a queen. But from now on she would be at the
mercy of others.</p>

<p>That is not what Geoffrey and his companions were thinking
about as they rode into the fabled streets, however. They
were remembering all they had heard about the magic city.
They were wondering if even half of it was true.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BYZANTIUM">BYZANTIUM,<br>
CROSSROADS OF THE WORLD</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">They found that it was true indeed.</p>

<p>On that hot July day when the crusaders and Venetians
at last forced their way with young Alexius into Constantinople,
it was neither as rich nor as powerful as it had been
when the earlier Alexius let the leaders of the First Crusade
cool their heels outside its gates more than a hundred years
before.</p>

<p>But if you wanted to find a more fabulous city, you would
have had to go all the way across Asia to distant Cathay.
There, of course, was Khansa (modern Hangchow), which
was so enormous that it took one medieval traveler three days
merely to cross from one side of it to the other. There, too,
was Khan Baliq (modern Peking) where “twice five miles of
fertile ground with walls and towers were girdled round”
just to make a playground for the Chinese Son of Heaven,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
or emperor. But since Marco Polo would not even be born
for another fifty years, most of the crusaders knew very little
about Cathay, that is, if they had even heard of it at all!</p>

<p>Their idea of a big city was London with its gloomy smoke-blackened
houses, and in those days London was really a
little town. Even Westminster Abbey was a mile in the country
and surrounded by green fields. Or Paris with its streets
so narrow that you could hardly see the sky between overhanging
gables, and with the great Cathedral of Notre Dame
not yet finished. Paris hardly extended a mile in any direction.
Or Bruges with its bent and wizened wool merchants
and the damp smell of its canals. Even Rome, the most
famous city in the West, could not have had much more than
30,000 inhabitants. Most of these were ruffians and bandits
who robbed pilgrims, fought each other, and even battled
the Pope from castles made of marble stolen from the ancient
monuments.</p>

<p>But Constantinople, at the crossroads of the world, gleamed
in the sun and was proud and mighty. Even then it had a population
of at least 800,000. Possibly a million people lived
there.</p>

<p>They were of every kind and race, for like modern New
York, the Byzantine city was a melting pot.</p>

<p>Swarthy Armenians looking for the fortune that had enabled
more than one of their number to mount the Byzantine
throne.</p>

<p>Intellectual Greek scholars moving toward the lecture room
with a precious copy of Plato or Aristotle under their arms.</p>

<p>Blond-haired Anglo-Saxons, described by one who saw
them to be “tall as palm trees.” Ever since William the Conqueror
had ruled in England, they had come in growing numbers
to join the famous Varangians, or imperial bodyguard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Russian traders bursting out of their own Saint Mamas
quarter in the city to drink the unfamiliar Greek wine which
made them quarrel and brawl.</p>

<p>Strikingly handsome Asbagians from Colchis, the land of
the legendary Golden Fleece, and probably of rich placer
gold mines almost like the ones in California.</p>

<p>Jewish merchants from the Pera quarter, on the other side
of the Golden Horn. They were not allowed to live in the city
itself which they had to reach by water, and they were often
oppressed and persecuted; but they were rich, benevolent,
and pious.</p>

<p>Unwashed, but shaven Bulgarians, who wore an iron chain
for a belt.</p>

<p>Wild, half-Mongol Patzinaks, and somewhat more civilized
Khazars from the Ukraine and the Caucasus.</p>

<p>Dark-eyed Asiatics with pointed beards and black hair, and
usually wearing turbans, who had come by camel caravan
from Syria or even Baghdad.</p>

<p>Iranians. Spaniards. Copts from ancient Egypt. Ethiopians
from fabled Axum. Franks and Lombards. In the old days,
there might also have been Indians and men from China, but
no longer. Bankers and sea captains from Amalfi, Pisa, and
Genoa. The latter in particular looked about them nervously.
They could not help wondering what their fate would be now
that their archenemy and rival, Venice, had taken over.</p>

<p>Finally, there were the Byzantines themselves. Proud and
haughty noblemen with strange titles you could hardly pronounce.
These noblemen moved through the streets arrogantly
and did not seem to know that their great days were over.
Sometimes a slave walked beside them, carrying a bright-colored
umbrella or parasol. Lovely ladies, beautifully
dressed, jeweled and painted, and probably with a smile for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
the tall, fair-haired northerners. Byzantine families, the wife
on a donkey, the husband and children on foot. Fierce-eyed
monks, of whom there were more than 30,000, and priests who
swarmed everywhere, led by their hegumens and archimandrites.
And, of course, the famous Byzantine peddlers with
their purposely ragged clothes, gesticulating hands, and
whining cries. The place was still a happy hunting ground
for hucksters.</p>

<p>“The city guarded by God”—the name given by the Byzantines
to Constantinople—was big enough to hold all of them
and splendid enough to make them glad that it could.</p>

<p>A medieval traveler said that the circumference of its walls
was eighteen miles, and although he was probably just as
good at telling tall stories as present-day travelers are, he may
have been right. At least if you included such flourishing suburbs
as Galata (once called Sycae, or Figtrees) and Scutari
(formerly Chrysopolis, or Gold City). Galata (like Pera) and
Scutari were separated from Constantinople by the Golden
Horn and the Bosporus, respectively, which were narrow
bodies of water, not as wide as the Hudson River or the East
River at New York City.</p>

<p>Constantinople itself was large enough. Like old Rome,
New Rome (for that was its official name; Constantinople, or
Constantine’s City, was only a nickname which had stuck)
sprawled over seven rolling hills and down to every body of
water it could find.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs120">THE GREAT PALACE IN CONSTANTINOPLE</p>

<br>

<p>That was what a visitor remembered most about Constantinople:
One was never far from the water. It was shaped like
a hitchhiker’s thumb pointed toward the shore of Asia Minor,
and it was bounded by sea on every side except where the
thumb joined the hand. On the north was the famous Golden
Horn—an arm of the Bosporus—which is still a wonderful harbor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>It is so deep that ships can moor with their prows against
the warehouses ashore and still be comfortably afloat. On the
north and northeast was the narrow Bosporus with its twisting
channel and its dangerous currents. Jason and his Argonauts
had supposedly sailed through the Bosporus. On the southeast
and south was the Sea of Marmara. On the Marmara shore
there were many small man-made harbors, at least one of
which was reserved for the emperor. Through the Sea of Marmara,
one could reach to the Dardanelles, the Aegean Sea,
and finally the Mediterranean; and then on to Egypt, the Red
Sea, and India in one direction, and to Spain and even England
in the other.</p>

<p>Guarded by these seas and by the great walls which protected
it from the west, some of which still stand, was an
<em>Arabian Nights’</em> fantasy of lovely vales and gardens, glittering
roofs and towers, and, of course, resplendent buildings that
were beyond anything that the adventurers from the cold
and foggy north could even imagine.</p>

<p>Among the crusaders was another knight who could write
as well as fight. His name was Robert of Clari.</p>

<p>“I do not think,” said Robert, “that in the forty richest cities
of the world there is as much treasure. In fact, the Greeks said
that two-thirds of all the wealth there is, is in Constantinople.
The rest is scattered elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Then he went into details.</p>

<p>Most glittering of all, he noted, was the Palace of Bukoleon.
“Within it,” he said, “there were fully five hundred halls, all
connected with one another and all made with gold mosaic.
In it, there were fully thirty chapels. One of them was called
the Holy Chapel, which was so rich and noble that there was
not a hinge or band or any part such as is usually made of iron
that was not all of silver. And there was no column that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
not of jasper or of porphyry or some other precious stone.”</p>

<p>The Palace of Bukoleon had got its name from a statue
showing a fight between a bull and a lion. It had been the
Great, or Sacred, Palace of the earlier emperors. It covered
25 or 30 acres and was really a collection of buildings, for a
Byzantine palace was never a single edifice.</p>

<p>There were too many buildings in the Great Palace to tell
you about all of them. Among them was the Daphne Palace.
It was the oldest one, having been built by Constantine the
Great when he founded the city. There was the Building of
the Nineteen Beds where the emperor could hold a state dinner
for 218 important people. Another building was the
Chalké where the emperor received his parade troops. It was
650 feet long, and in the old days it was guarded by Khazars
with drawn bows. It got its name because its roof was a huge
sheet of polished copper. A fourth building was the Magnaura,
or Fresh Breeze, Palace where the empress went in
stately procession to take her ceremonial baths.</p>

<p>It was at the Magnaura Palace that an Italian visitor discovered
what the Byzantines would do to impress strangers.
Liutprand, the bishop of Cremona, was led before the emperor,
whom he found seated upon a golden throne. There he
was told to bow himself three times, each time with his face
to the ground.</p>

<p>He did so; then he looked up. No emperor.</p>

<p>By a clever device, the latter had been lifted to the ceiling,
and now clad in entirely new clothes, he looked down upon
the bishop. In the meantime, gilded mechanical birds began
to sing, and gilded bronze lions beat the ground with their
tails and roared terribly with open mouth and quivering
tongues.</p>

<p>Part of the palace group, too, was the renowned church of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Santa Sophia. It was known as the Great Church, and although
it was not as big as Saint Peter’s in Rome, it was one of
the largest sacred buildings ever made by man. Even today,
with most of its mosaics covered with whitewash—this was
done by the Turks—it is like nothing else in the world. To
Robert of Clari, its great height, equivalent to a modern
eighteen-story building, its many chapels, its lacelike balconies,
and its beautifully carved pillars made it like the work
of an enchanter. Its dome was so vast that the architects had
to try twice before they could make one that would not fall
down. When they did, it was so graceful that it seemed to be
floating on air.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="30-31" style="max-width: 116.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/30-31.jpg" alt="Byzantium city">
</figure>
<br>

<p>But what impressed Robert of Clari most of all was its
more-than-Oriental splendor. The principal altar was beyond
price, he said. The altar table was 14 feet long. It was made
of gold and precious stones crushed up together. Above it was
a solid silver canopy held up by solid silver columns. The
whole ceiling was overlaid with pure gold. Robert did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
even speak of the mosaics which we now know were as fine as
any ever made, but he did say that there were more than 200
chandeliers. Each of these had twenty-five or more lamps,
and was hung from a silver chain as thick as a man’s arm.</p>

<p>Last but not least of the palace buildings was the Hippodrome,
or Circus. This was a tremendous stadium about 2,000
feet long and 600 feet wide. On three sides of it were thirty
or forty rows of seats, and at the north end was the Cathisma,
or balcony, where the emperor and empress sat in state. It
must have held 100,000 people.</p>

<p>In the days of old the Hippodrome was the center of almost
every kind of citizen activity. Here were held wildly exciting
chariot races during which the Green and Blue factions (they
were like the Democrats and Republicans in the United
States) forgot their politics to bet on their favorites, and were
ready to fly at each other with stones or swords if the wrong
one got ahead. Here there were wild beast fights, bearbaiting,
acrobatic feats, performances by clowns, jugglers, trained
dogs, and even a trained, gilded crocodile. But not fights by
gladiators, for the Christian Byzantines did not think it was
right for one man to kill another in the name of sport.</p>

<p>Here, too, the emperor-elect stood to hear the crowds proclaim
him, and it was here that more than once he had to face
the people and promise to obey his own laws. Some very
bloody riots, called the Nika revolt, started at the Hippodrome,
and it was there that they were put down with a loss
of 30,000 lives.</p>

<p>But Robert of Clari did not limit his sightseeing to the
Great Palace and its grounds. He went everywhere. He visited
the new Palace of Blachernae by the Golden Horn and
saw that it was almost as splendid as the Bukoleon, even
though it had <em>only</em> twenty chapels and two or three hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
chambers! He stood at the Golden Gate with its two life-sized
elephants made of copper. This gate was only opened when
the emperor, called the Augustus, returned from a victory.
Then he was taken through it seated on a golden throne on a
golden four-wheeled chariot. The clergy scattered incense,
and the crowd shouted, “Life eternal to our holy Augustus!”</p>

<p>Robert also saw the Gate of the Golden Mantle with its
shining globe which was supposed to protect the city from
being destroyed by lightning. A statue on the globe proclaimed
in large letters: “Anyone who lives in Constantinople
a year can be rich enough to afford a golden mantle like the
one I wear.”</p>

<p>He saw the great monument to Justinian. It towered into
the air, and on top of it was a bronze statue of this mighty
emperor. He was on horseback and wore a headdress very
much like that of an Aztec chieftain.</p>

<p>He also saw the holy relics with which the city was filled—two
pieces of the true cross, the head of the lance that pierced
Christ’s side, two of the nails used in the Crucifixion, a vial
containing the Saviour’s blood, the tunic that He wore on the
first Good Friday, the crown of thorns itself, and the famous
“handkerchief of Edessa” on which His portrait had been
imprinted by a miracle.</p>

<p>Last of all, Robert of Clari gawked at the two columns each
of which prophesied the city’s doom. “Even our coming was
predicted,” he said.</p>

<p>But no one in Constantinople understood what the ships
and soldiers on the columns meant until the crusaders were
actually there. Then the frightened people realized that short-haired
warriors with iron swords would come from the West
to conquer them. By that time, it was too late.</p>

<p>But there was much more to this Byzantine city than palaces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
and monuments and churches. It was a city of people as
well as the city of the emperor, and it was all noise and excitement,
hustle and bustle, and activity.</p>

<p>No part of it was busier than the long avenue that started
at the Augustaion, or Emperor Square, in front of Santa
Sophia, and went three or four miles to the city walls. It was
called the Mesé, or Midway, and it was really like a modern
midway in the variety of wares it offered.</p>

<p>Here, for example, under its colonnades and porticoes were
the workbenches of the goldsmiths. In plain sight of everybody,
they manufactured lovely gold boxes, gold jewelry,
and intricate enamel. Near the goldsmiths were the money
changers with their long tables or banks heaped with the coin
of every nation. Next came the provision sellers, those who
sold every kind of food from meat and cheese to bread and
honey. The sellers of silk had their booths between the Forum
of Constantine and the Taurus Forum, with its tall column
and statue of Theodosius. The perfume sellers did their business
in front of the Great Palace. In other places—but I could
not name them all—there was a bazaar so filled with gleaming
wares that it was called the house of lamps, a street of the
tinsmiths and coppersmiths, a bazaar for household goods, a
pig-and-sheep market, a cattle market, and, of course, a horse
market.</p>

<p>Noisier than all the others, and more filled with bargaining
in twenty Near East languages was the fish market, located on
the quays by the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>The Mesé was a respectable place and one was safe, at least
in daylight, when visiting the booths and markets; but to go
anywhere else in the city was another matter. To be sure,
there was nothing in the world as magnificent as the glitter
and the gold of Caesar City. But outside of the native quarter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
in a city in Algiers or Morocco, there were no slums like the
slums of Constantinople. They spread all over, covering acre
after acre of ground, and they made up a miserable network
of filthy side streets and dark, damp, and dirty tenements.
There was absolutely no sanitation. The gutters were the
only sewers. Household refuse, including spoiled meat and
vegetables and ancient and decaying fish, were thrown out
of slitlike windows to be trampled under foot by every passerby.
In rainy weather the mud was more than ankle deep.
One can imagine how it smelled.</p>

<p>Here lived the working population of the city—porters with
calluses on their hands and padded coats, donkey drivers with
shrill cries and quick, short steps like those that can be seen
even today in many a city in the Balkans. Carpenters. Water
carriers. Day laborers. Here too lived an even more wretched
riffraff who lived off doles and charity, when they didn’t live
off murder and crime. Here was the poor creature with sore
eyes who sat with his wooden begging bowl in front of a
church or on the sunny side of a square. Here was a one-eyed
scoundrel who would cut throats for a copper obol. Yet sometimes
they gathered together and formed a mob that marched
to the Hippodrome and demanded a new emperor, and more
than once they got what they wanted.</p>

<p>This was what Constantinople was like in the late Middle
Ages and for 600 years before that. But it was also much more
than a seething pot of emperors and rich men, poor men,
beggarmen, and thieves.</p>

<p>It was the capital of a very famous empire which took over
the eastern half of the old Roman Empire and became known
as the Byzantine Empire because it stood on the site of the
ancient Greek city of Byzantium. In spite of all its enemies,
this empire lasted 1,123 years and eighteen days. And at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
time when half a dozen other empires crumbled, including
ancient Persia and ancient Rome!</p>
<br>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ROMAN_EMPIRE">THE ROMAN EMPIRE<br>
AND CONSTANTINOPLE</h2>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p class="no-indent">The beginning o£ the story took place a long time ago, and
not even in the same land.</p>

<p>Back in the days when our ancestors still dressed in skins
and hides and had just given up stone weapons for bronze, a
group of people moved out of central Europe to the north of
Italy. They stayed there for a thousand years, made pottery
and grew beans, beets, barley, and millet and finally learned
how to use iron. They also grazed cattle and herded sheep,
and so one day when they learned that the coastland from
the Tiber River to the Bay of Naples was so lush with tall
green grass that it was called Vitelia (the name Italy comes
from mispronouncing this), or Calfland, they moved south
again.</p>

<p>There they settled in the rugged blue hills, and there they
became the various Italian tribes. Most important of these to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
our story were the Latins. For reasons of safety, these Latins,
like the others, lived in the craggiest places they could find,
but they always came down to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">campania</i>, as the level land
was called, to fatten their lowing herds. And in 754 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, according
to Roman legend, twin brothers, Romulus and
Remus, decided to stay there. They became chieftains of a
band of robber cattle-herders, and at the exact spot where
the twins said they had been nourished as babes by a she-wolf
(who some say was a woman named Lupa, the Latin word
for “wolf”), they founded a small town of mud-and-wattle
houses.</p>

<p>They named it Rome after Romulus, the older twin. Little
did anyone dream that one day it would be one of the most
famous cities in the world! Still less did anyone imagine that
the Romans would march out of it to conquer the world!</p>

<p>But that is just exactly what they did. In the beginning,
they had troubles and trials. In fact, an old story says that
when the Gauls from France invaded the city, the capital
was saved only when a gaggle of geese cackled and warned
the senators.</p>

<p>But the Romans were stubborn, good fighters, well-disciplined,
and no matter how bitterly they battled each other
in more than one bloody civil war, they always stood together
when they faced an enemy. By the time of Julius Caesar 700
years later, they had reached the English Channel in one direction
and the Caspian Sea in the other. When Trajan was
emperor (about 100 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), practically every part of the known
civilized world was included in their empire. Of the eighty-two
countries in the United Nations at the time this book was
written, all or a part of at least thirty were in Trajan’s empire,
and a great majority of the other fifty-two countries are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
lands, like America, that hadn’t been discovered. They were
ruled by one man.</p>

<p>What is more, soon all the inhabitants of all these lands
were Roman citizens. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Civis Romanus sum.</i> I am a Roman
citizen. This could be said by longhaired Celts walking the
heather in Britain; by Berbers in the Atlas Mountains in
Africa; by haughty Spaniards (Trajan himself was born in
Spain); by Gauls in France, Egyptians, Greeks, Syrians,
Arabs; even by Scythians and Sarmatians from South Russia,
and by Germans from across the Rhine.</p>

<p>This was a great achievement that had never happened
before, but it also made a lot of difficulties.</p>

<p>Take size alone. The Roman Empire was now too big to
manage. In those days, you couldn’t fly a general (or a tax
collector, or an imperial officer, or the emperor himself) from
York, England—that’s where Constantine the Great was
when he started toward Rome to become the Roman emperor—to
the Persian border in a matter of hours. You couldn’t even
put him on a fast train. The Roman roads were famous, but
the only way you could travel them was on foot, on horseback,
or in a litter or chariot. And from one end of the empire
to the other was 3,000 miles!</p>

<p>Two centuries after Trajan, an emperor called Diocletian
decided to do something about it. Diocletian was the son of a
freed slave, but he became the first absolute ruler the Roman
Empire ever had. Before that the emperor was merely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">princeps</i>
(from which the English word “prince” is derived), or
first citizen. But once Diocletian had all this power, he proceeded
to divide it up. He appointed a co-emperor (a second
Augustus) with an assistant emperor called a <em>caesar</em> to help
him, and put him in charge of the Roman Empire in the West.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
Diocletian himself, with his own <em>caesar</em>, kept the East. Although
he was still head emperor and the other emperor was
supposed to obey him, the Roman Empire was now divided
into two parts.</p>

<p>About forty years later, another emperor took an even more
important step. Constantine the Great decided that the empire
needed a second capital as much as it needed two rulers,
and since he was a Christian emperor—actually he was the
first Christian emperor—he decided it must be a Christian
city.</p>

<p>He looked around him carefully. First he thought of Nicomedia
(now Ismid in modern Turkey) where Diocletian had
had his camp; but it had been the capital of a heathen king.
Then he considered ancient Troy, for the Romans were supposed
to be descended from the Trojans. He even began to
build walls there. But one day somebody reminded him of the
ruined city of Byzantium with its wonderful location.</p>

<p>“That is the place!” he cried.</p>

<p>On foot, with lance in hand and followed by a solemn procession,
he marched over pleasant hills and valleys that were
still covered with vines and greenery.</p>

<p>As they tried to keep up with him his panting courtiers
asked him how big he planned to make the place.</p>

<p>“I shall walk,” he replied, “until God, my invisible Guide,
bids me to halt.”</p>

<p>An emperor could get things done in those days. Not much
more than four years from the day, hour, and minute that
Constantine ordered his architects and engineers and builders
to get to work, the city was completed and ready to live
in. It was equipped with theaters, public baths, senate houses,
a university, courts of justice, granaries, palaces, and magnificent
private dwellings, many of them the very ones described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
by Robert of Clari. It had broad squares, paved avenues,
classic porticoes, and aqueducts that brimmed with clear, cool
water. It was decorated with marbles, statues, and priceless
works of art; at the emperor’s command, the cities of Greece
and Asia Minor had been rifled of their most precious treasures
to make sure of this.</p>

<p>It was filled with people too. Constantine invited (that was
the same thing as <em>ordered</em>) senators to move from Rome. He
presented costly buildings to his favorites. He confiscated the
estates of many of his rich subjects, especially in Asia Minor,
and gave the income to those of his subjects who agreed to
live in the new city. Of course, a lot of people came of their
own accord. They wanted to get in on something good.</p>

<p>It was lucky indeed that Diocletian and Constantine had
taken these steps. For suddenly the Roman Empire began to
quake and tremble. All through recorded history and long
before, the barbarians from the northern swamps and forests
of Europe kept pouring down upon the lands to the south of
them. As a matter of fact, the Romans, as well as the Greeks
whom Homer wrote his poems about, were from the north.
When Homer spoke of the “golden-haired Achaeans,” he was
talking about the Greeks. But the men around the Mediterranean—the
original Greeks—were dark, as they are today.
The Achaeans came from the north.</p>

<p>For a long time Roman might had kept these tribesmen
back, and civilization and a comfortable life had flourished.
As many men lived in peace or happiness as ever have before
or since.</p>

<p>But now all at once Rome grew weak almost as fast as it
had grown powerful, and the barbarians rode again. Almost
immediately they were able to cross the frontiers whenever
they wanted to. Soon the empire couldn’t hold them off at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Less than a century after Constantine, Alaric the Goth
marched into Rome and burned a great deal of the city. Forty-five
years later another tribe, the Vandals, destroyed the
rest. We get the word “vandalism” from the Vandals. It
means the willful destruction of something beautiful, which
is what the Vandals did. After the Vandals other Germanic
tribes, with their horned helmets and their long yellow hair,
came streaming in, bringing their women and children with
them. They were followed by the Mongolian Huns and Avars.</p>

<p>In 476 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, one of the barbarian chiefs decided it was foolish
to pretend any longer. He deposed the then Roman
emperor, Romulus Augustulus (a Latin name meaning “Romulus,
the little Augustus”), and proclaimed himself king of
Italy. Thus ended the Roman Empire in the West.</p>

<p>If it had not been for Diocletian and Constantine, it would
also have ended the Roman Empire everywhere. It might
have ended Western civilization, too.</p>

<p>But the emperor of the Roman Empire in the East stood
safe behind his mighty walls, and he announced as quickly
as possible that he was now emperor of the whole Roman
Empire. He ordered this barbarian king of Italy and all the
other barbarian kings to acknowledge him as emperor and
overlord.</p>

<p>Many of them did.</p>

<p>That is probably the most important thing to remember
about the Byzantines. They considered themselves Romans.
Most people in the West called them Greeks, and indeed they
spoke Greek and were Greek in many other ways. They were
also Orientals in their splendor. But for at least the first 900
years of their history they thought of themselves as Romans
and were proud of it. Their emperor was still the Augustus,
and his other title <em>autokrator</em> was a Greek translation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperator</i>, or commander in chief. Even when he later
took the proud title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basileus</i>, a Greek equivalent for the
Persian “king of kings,” he was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basileus tou Romaion</i>, king of
the Romans. To call him “Greek emperor,” as did some Westerners,
was to use a fighting word.</p>

<p>The second most important thing to remember about the
Byzantines was that Constantinople never fell into the hands
of the enemy. This means that the empire never fell into the
hands of the barbarians, for in those days the capital was even
more important than it is today, and so in spite of all the
lands it governed, Constantinople <em>was</em> the empire. As long as
it stood, the empire stood. The Byzantines had plenty of
troubles, and more than once saw the turbans and scimitars
of the Arabs, and the felt hats and yellow faces of the followers
of some steppe-riding khagan, right beneath their walls.
But except when he was invited, no foreign invader had ever
set foot in the streets of Constantinople until Geoffrey of Villehardouin
and Robert of Clari came with their fellow crusaders.</p>

<p>It is a fact that for century after century, when almost
every other important city in the world was sacked and looted
over and over again, the Byzantines were able to make and
keep Constantinople safe. It was a place of refuge for men
and for ideas and for the civilization the Greeks and Romans
had given them and for the ideals of Christianity in the midst
of a stormy world.</p>

</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p class="no-indent">The Byzantines were able to keep Constantinople safe because
they were one of the few peoples living in the time
between the fall of Rome and modern days who had a strong
government and one that worked. The rest of the Roman
Empire had been divided by conquest into a good hundred or
more independent units. These were ruled by kings, princes,
dukes, marquises, and counts, and some cities were even free
republics headed by wrangling priors. Their boundaries were
always changing, and nobody ever knew just who was governing
whom today, and who would be tomorrow. But the eastern
half of the Roman Empire had a single government which
was almost always orderly.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were able to do it because they had a fine
army, and when they needed it, a swift and deadly navy—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
say nothing of a diplomatic corps with a well-paid staff of
skillful, highly trained diplomats.</p>

<p>They were able to do it because of their Christianity. After
Antioch (in Syria) and Alexandria (in Egypt) had been captured
by the Arabs, Constantinople was the most important
Christian city except Rome. And as far as the Byzantines were
concerned, the state worked for Christianity, and Christianity
worked for the state.</p>

<p>Finally, the Byzantine Empire was able to stand firm and
to last so long because the Byzantines could afford to spend
what they needed to. Their government was tremendously
expensive. Their army and their navy with its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strategoi</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">drungariuses</i> (generals and admirals) cost them a lot of
money and so did their extravagant ambassadors. The church
with its own mighty army of high officials and lesser functionaries
was very expensive too.</p>

<p>But as long as the Byzantines were not only able to support
emperor, army, navy, diplomats, and the church, but were
<em>willing</em> to do so, the Byzantine Empire flourished and was
great. It was only after they began to economize, when a lot
of Byzantines decided they were spending too much on the
army, that their troubles began.</p>

<p>At the head of the government was the emperor, and he
was certainly the most absolute ruler there could possibly be.
Even in the earliest days of the empire, he was chief of the
Byzantine state, commander in chief of the army and navy,
the only one who could make laws, and the head of the Byzantine
courts. In other words, he was equivalent to the President,
Congress, and the Supreme Court of the United States
rolled into one.</p>

<p>When he became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basileus</i>, he was even more than that.
The Great King was master and owner as well as sovereign,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
and his subjects became slaves. They had to humble themselves
on the ground before him, and foreigners had to as
well. Beside that, he was the head of the Byzantine church
(now known as the Greek, or Orthodox Eastern, Church),
and in this connection took on another title, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">isapostolos</i>, which
is Greek for “equal to the Apostles.”</p>

<p>But in spite of his great power, in many ways he was a
democratic emperor who was elected or at least chosen by a
process carefully set down by law. First he had to be named
by either the senate or the army. Then he had to be approved
by whichever of those two bodies that had not named him
in the first place. Finally he had to be hailed by the people.
(This was true even when the emperor seized power or when
an emperor named his son co-emperor so that he would be
sure to succeed him. He still had to be approved and hailed.)
But once the emperor was elected, he was “the emperor chosen
by God,” for the Byzantines firmly believed that God guided
them in everything they did. From then on, it was not only
treason but wicked and sinful to oppose the emperor. That
is, unless you were successful. If you led a successful revolution,
it meant that God had chosen you to take the old emperor’s
place!</p>

<p>The empress—the Augusta, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basilissa</i>, as she was also
called—was almost equally important. To be sure, in the long
history of the Byzantine Empire, only three women actually
mounted the throne to rule in their own name, and only one
of these amounted to anything. This was the wicked Irene
who wanted to marry Charlemagne and who blinded her own
son so she could stay in power. However, she did not call herself
empress. She called herself emperor of the Romans just
as if she had been a man.</p>

<p>But even though she rarely ruled, the empress was not shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
up in a harem, and many empresses had great power and
even greater influence.</p>

<p>Ariadne, the widow of an early emperor, went before the
people and told them that her husband was dead. “Choose
us a new ruler!” they clamored. She named a palace official,
and then she married him. He was a very good ruler.</p>

<p>Zoe, the daughter of another emperor, did even better. She
married three men, and each in turn became emperor.</p>

<p>More than that. The nephew of her second husband persuaded
her to adopt him and name him her co-emperor. Then
he had her hair shorn and shipped her off to the Princes
Islands, in the Sea of Marmara, as a nun.</p>

<p>The crowds surged around the palace. “Where is our lovely
lady,” they shouted, “whose father, grandfather, and great-grandfather
ruled before her?” The usurper had to bring her
back, but even that did not save him. He ended in a monastery
himself.</p>

<p>Saint Theodora (the wife of an emperor and the mother
of one) used her influence to end a religious dispute that had
disturbed the state for more than 100 years, while another
Theodora, who was far from a saint, saved it from revolution.</p>

<p>This happened when the Greens and the Blues (the rival
political parties) joined forces and revolted against Justinian,
the greatest Byzantine emperor of all. After they had burned
much of the city, they surged into the Circus and called on
the emperor to abdicate.</p>

<p>The mighty Justinian, who had even ordered a ship ready
for a quick escape, was about to give in when suddenly his
empress, Theodora, stood beside him. She was an ex-circus
girl, one of the people herself.</p>

<p>“You can do what you want to,” she told him, her eyes
flashing. “I am going to stay here. Anyone who puts on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
crown must never take it off. If I die, I am going to be buried
in imperial purple!”</p>

<p>The emperor was ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>“Drive them back to their warrens!” he ordered two of his
toughest generals.</p>

<p>Within hours, the riots were put down.</p>

<p>But even when the empress did not do things like this, she
was very important. For this reason a widower emperor remarried
as soon as possible. Leo the Philosopher married four
times and got into almost as much trouble as Henry VIII. If
an emperor didn’t remarry, he made his daughter the Augusta.</p>

<p>“When there is not an Augusta,” wrote a Byzantine, “it is
not possible to celebrate holidays or give banquets or entertainments
in the manner prescribed by law.”</p>

<p>That may not seem important to us, but it was very important
to the Byzantines. Since the emperor was God’s representative
on earth, every official act of his life had to be like
a church service, and in almost every one of the more than
eighty occasions described in detail in an instruction book
for emperors called <em>The Book of Ceremonies</em>, the empress
took part.</p>

<p>It was something to see the royal pair on any great Byzantine
holiday, for example, May 11, when they celebrated the
founding of the city.</p>

<p>On this day the statue of Constantine the Great was paraded
through the city in a golden chariot drawn by white
mules, and the emperor sat in the Hippodrome waiting to
pay honor to it. He was clad in robes that literally glittered.
His principal garment was a tunic which reached almost to
his ankles. This was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scaramangion</i> and was so stiff
with brocade that it could have stood by itself. Over this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
a shorter garment called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saigon</i>. It was purple, gold-embroidered,
and seeded with pearls. On his head he wore the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stemmata</i>, or imperial crown. It twinkled with rubies and sapphires
of the purest ray serene. On his feet were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">campagia</i>,
or special boots that only the emperor could wear.
These too were of imperial purple, although some people say
this imperial purple was really a deep crimsony red.</p>

<p>The empress sat at his side, just as splendid as he. Her garments
were much like his, but on her crown was a plume
made of precious stones. She wore earrings that dangled far
below her shoulders, and sometimes a neckpiece made of oval
or pear-shaped pearls. If he was a solid gold emperor, she was
a solid gold empress too.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of all the splendor and glory (and this is only a
little bit of it), the Byzantine emperor did not have to be
royally born. In the Byzantine Empire it was just as easy to
rise from a hovel to the throne as it is to be born in humble circumstances
and become President of the United States.</p>

<p>Many of the emperors did.</p>

<p>An early emperor had been a butcher. Another had been
a swineherd from Macedonia, and the great Justinian was this
swineherd’s nephew. The savage Phocas was originally a centurion
(a top sergeant). Still another had once been a donkey
trader who moved from one country fair to another. Basil I
was raised as a Balkan farm boy. He was very tall and strong
and attracted the attention of the reigning emperor because
he could tame horses. A later emperor had been a petty officer
in the navy. Still another was originally a dockyard
worker.</p>

<p>Many of the empresses were humbly born too. Besides
Theodora, the circus girl, there was one who had been a cook,
and a third who was the daughter of a saloonkeeper. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Saint Theodora was brought up in poverty because her father,
who had once been a courtier, had given all his money to the
poor.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="52-53" style="max-width: 81.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/52-53.jpg" alt="Horse scenes">
</figure>
<br>

<p>Saint Theodora became empress when the emperor picked
his bride by following an old custom of the Byzantine emperors.
Wishing to marry, he sent messengers throughout his
realm, telling them to bring back the most beautiful young
women they could find. Seventeen were paraded before him,
and when the one he was about to choose annoyed him by a
flippant answer she made, he chose Theodora.</p>

<p>Theodora did not intend to stay poor like her father. One
day, her husband, the emperor, looked out of the window and
saw a rich, heavily laden merchant vessel sail in and tie up to
a wharf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder who owns it,” he mused.</p>

<p>“It is mine,” said the empress.</p>

<p>The emperor flew into a fury. <em>His</em> wife should not be engaged
in trade like some huckster. He made her sell it, but he
did let her keep the profits.</p>

<p>Because these rulers were the emperors chosen by God, the
Byzantines bowed their knee to them as the ancient Egyptians
had to the Pharaohs. But because they were from the
people, and also because the Byzantines had sharp tongues
and liked to be sarcastic, the people sometimes gave their
rulers a rough time.</p>

<p>There were more than 100 emperors in the long period of
the Byzantine Empire, and many of them were given nicknames.
Some of these nicknames were far from flattering.</p>

<p>Here are just a few: Justinian Nose-Cut-Off. (This was Justinian
II, not the great Justinian.) Constantine the Stable
Boy. Michael the Stutterer. Michael the Drunkard. Constantine
Born-in-the-Purple. Basil the Bulgar Slayer. Michael
Thinks-He’s-a-Soldier. Even one empress had a nickname;
Leo the Philosopher’s fourth wife was called Zoe Black Eyes.</p>

<p>The emperors had to put up with sarcastic epigrams, disrespectful
poems, and uncomplimentary stories. Here is one
of them: Michael Thinks-He’s-a-Soldier had a passion for city
planning, but he hated to spend money. One day the Byzantines
saw a principal avenue all torn up. The pavement had
been removed and workmen were everywhere.</p>

<p>“What is happening?” asked one of them. “Oh, yes! I remember!
That’s where the emperor lost one of his halfpenny
dice when he was a small boy. He’s tearing up the pavement
to find it!”</p>

<p>But in spite of all this, or maybe because of it, the Byzantine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
state was about as solid as was possible. Not even revolutions
could really shake it.</p>

<p>One reason may have been the fact that since the emperors
came from every class and were often changing, the Byzantines
were constantly getting new and vigorous blood in their
government. But another reason was the wonderful and well-organized
body of bureaucrats who helped the emperor govern
the empire. When there was a strong emperor, these men
carried out his orders. When there was a weak emperor, they
did the best they could, until a new, strong emperor mounted
the throne.</p>

<p>There was really nothing like this group in any other government
in the world until modern times. They were trained
public servants, headed by high officials who were appointed
by the emperor.</p>

<p>The most important of these officials was the Logothete of
the Dromos. (The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">logothete</i> really means accountant,
but it is like a secretary in the United States Cabinet.) He
was also known as the Grand Logothete. He was secretary of
state, minister of police, and secretary of the interior.</p>

<p>Besides that, there was a Logothete of the Treasury who
was like the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States; a
Logothete of the Military Chest, who was the paymaster general
of the army and navy; and a Logothete of the Flocks and
Herds who was in charge of all the vast imperial estates.
Among other things, he ran the imperial horse farms where
practically all the horses needed by the empire and the army
were raised.</p>

<p>There was also the Sacellerius, or Controller General; the
Quaestor, or Minister of Justice; the Grand Domestic, or commander
in chief of the army; and the Grand Drungarius, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
secretary of the navy. These are only a few of the most important
officials.</p>

<p>Under these department heads—and even more important—were
the humble clerks who really did the work of government.
These clerks were banded together into a body called
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">logothesia</i> which was almost like our modern civil service.
They were well paid, and even the lowest-ranking workers
had unlimited opportunities for graft. In those days, graft was
not considered dishonest; it was more like the tip that you
give to a waiter for his service.</p>

<p>The clerks were also rewarded with honors. Every Byzantine
working for the government had two titles. One described
his job, such as chief clerk to the third assistant to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eparch</i>, or lord mayor of Constantinople. The other was the
rank given to him to recognize his services. Around the emperor
alone there were twenty-six ranks, ranging in order of
importance from <em>caesar</em> down to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nipsistarios</i>, a man who
sprinkled symbolic holy water on the sovereign. In the city
and throughout the empire were sixty other ranks. The badge
that was the symbol of each of these was as important to a
Byzantine as his pay.</p>

<p>It was this government, and most of all its lower-rank employees,
that really ran the Byzantine Empire, for nobody
could get on without them. Emperors and even logothetes
came and went, but the Byzantine civil service clerks were
always there. If an army had to be sent to an overseas province,
the clerks knew how many ships and how much time it
would take to get there. If there was a famine, they knew
how many bushels of wheat were needed to feed Constantinople,
and where to get them.</p>

<p>They were for the most part plain citizens from all over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Byzantine state who had come to the capital not to get rich
but just to make a living. They were noisy. They liked to argue.
They were quarrelsome and jealous. As they jostled
through the crowded streets toward their homes or pushed
their way onto the crowded Mesé to buy silk for their wives
or food for their larder, they reeked of garlic and highly
spiced fish. But they kept the empire alive.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_ROMAN_ARMY">A ROMAN ARMY<br>
ON HORSEBACK</h2>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p class="no-indent">The army kept the empire going too.</p>

<p>It called itself the Roman army; and this Roman army of
the Greek Byzantine Empire was about as efficient as any
body of armed men between the time of Julius Caesar and the
days of gunpowder and artillery.</p>

<p>Actually, though, Julius Caesar would have been astonished
if he had seen it. Who, he would have asked, were these
swarthy-skinned, black-bearded men with their quick and
glinting Asiatic eyes? The commands seemed to be given in
Latin, but the accent made them hard to understand. Why
were so many of them on prancing, spirited horses?</p>

<p>Caesar would have remembered his legions like the famous
Tenth Legion with which he landed in Britain. Rome had
conquered the world with her legions. The legion was a body
of from 4,000 to 6,000 citizen-soldiers. Except for a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
handful who were mounted for scouting, the legion was made
up entirely of foot soldiers. The tough men who fought in its
ranks were clean-shaven, and each one carried a large shield.
He wore a round helmet and a leather cuirass, and was armed
with a short Spanish thrusting sword (that is, you didn’t hack
with it) and a short throwing spear called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilum</i>.</p>

<p>But when in 378 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, a mighty Roman emperor was surrounded
and crushed by barbarian horsemen in a Balkan
valley not more than 150 miles from Constantinople, the infantry
and the legion did not look unbeatable any more.</p>

<p>The Byzantines decided not to rely on it.</p>

<p>So first Caesar would have seen a large array of well-equipped
men on sturdy chargers. These were the heavy cavalry,
later known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cataphracts</i>. They were as renowned as any
Byzantine troops. They wore steel caps, and on each cap was
a crest showing the colors of that <em>bandon</em>, or horse regiment.
They also wore long mail shirts, steel gauntlets, steel shoes,
and sometimes a light surcoat. Even the horses, at least those
of the officers and the men in the front rank, had steel head
armor and breastplates. For weapons, each man had a broadsword,
a dagger, a bow and a quiver of arrows, and a long
lance with a banderole, also in the <em>bandon</em> colors. They could
charge like knights, or by acting as bowmen, they could fight
a distant enemy.</p>

<p>Then Caesar would have seen the light troopers, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trapezidae</i>.
These too were cavalry, but they were the light cavalry.
They did carry shields, but for body armor they wore only a
cuirass of very light mail or horn. For weapons, they had only
a lance and a sword.</p>

<p>There was still infantry in the Byzantine army, but it was
now pretty unimportant. It was used mostly for holding
ground which the cavalry had won. But even the infantry was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
divided into two groups. The heavy infantry were about as
well armored as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cataphracts</i>. For weapons, they carried a
short, heavy battle ax and a dagger. They could stand off a
barbarian cavalry charge. The light infantry wore no armor,
but carried long-range bows. The Byzantine method of fighting
was something like the German blitzkrieg, with cavalry
taking the place of swiftly moving tanks and the foot soldiers
following behind.</p>

<p>The Byzantines did much more than change their army
into something swift and moving, however. They did more
than divide the old clumsy legion into smaller units almost
like our modern regiments, battalions, companies, and platoons.
They spent a lot of time thinking about the whole business
of fighting and may even have been the inventors of
carefully planned strategy. They would not have been at all
surprised at our modern war colleges where even generals are
taught in the classroom what to do on the field of battle.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, at least three Byzantine emperors wrote
very good books on the art of war. These books included
much more than just how to equip and drill an army. They
also told the general exactly how he should fight his battles,
and they emphasized that he must have a different kind of
warfare for each different kind of foe.</p>

<p>The Franks, for example—and by the Franks, the Byzantines
meant German and north Italian peoples quite as much
as French and Normans—believe, said the books, that a retreat
under any circumstances is dishonorable. Better die
than show your back to the enemy. They are also very careless
about outposts and scouts. So if you are fighting the
Franks, you should try to trap them in a place where they
will be at a disadvantage. Then you can annihilate them.</p>

<p>With the Turks—and by the Turks, the Byzantines also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
meant the Hungarians, the Patzinaks, and all the people of
the Asiatic steppes—it is another matter, the books continued.
They are light horsemen who carry bow and arrow as well
as javelin and scimitar. They are hard to surprise because they
always post mounted sentinels. Also you must be careful if
you pursue them, for they don’t stay defeated but rally
quickly. However, the heavy Byzantine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cataphracts</i> can ride
them down and cut them to pieces. They are supposed to do
so. And the Turks do not dare attack the Byzantine infantry
because of its strong and powerful bows.</p>

<p>The Slavs, on the other hand, are only dangerous when they
are led by Bulgarian khagans or by viking princes, and even
then they are only really dangerous when they are in the hills.
The thing to do, said the strategy books, is to lure them to the
plains in hope of plunder. And then destroy them.</p>

<p>But the really difficult enemy faced by the Byzantines were
the newly risen Arabs, or Saracens.</p>

<p>These wild sheiks from the desert were fanatically brave,
for Mohammed had taught them that the easiest way to get to
heaven was to die killing the unbeliever. Their numbers were
limitless, for after they had conquered Egypt and Syria they
drew into their ranks every discontented person in the Middle
East. Once a year they poured, like a horde of locusts, through
the gates of the Taurus Mountains into what today is southern
Turkey. Nothing, including the Byzantine army, could
stop them.</p>

<p>But fortunately, if they were wild and brave, they were also
greedy for plunder, and besides that they could not stand cold
or rain. So once a year too, usually in October or November,
they turned back again, and their mules and camels, loaded
down with booty, could not move back as fast as they had
come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“This is the way to beat them,” said one of the strategy
books. “Always know where they are. Whether you are eating,
taking a bath or sleeping, never turn away a man who
says that he has information. Whether he is a freeman or a
slave—no matter who he is!”</p>

<p>And then track them down, catching them in the narrow,
snowy, chilly mountain passes if possible. They won’t fight
well when they are trapped and shivering. Or if they don’t
go back of their own accord, raid their own country and in
this way bait them back. But whenever you fight them, or
anyone else, be sure you know what you are doing. Above all,
don’t throw everything into the battle at once. The general
with the last reserves always wins.</p>

<p>The Byzantines also taught their generals not only how to
fight but when to fight, and also when not to fight, which was
even more important. They believed that it was better to be
safe than sorry. The Byzantine general was told that he must
never be rash, and above everything he must never throw his
troops into battle where they might be killed or wounded if
he could win the day by stratagems or tricks.</p>

<p>To be sure, he must always keep his pledged word. If he
didn’t, who would believe him next time? And the lives of
captives must always be spared if possible. One day they
might be on the Byzantine side.</p>

<p>But it was all right to send an officer under a flag of truce
and have him pretend that he wanted to discuss terms for
surrender, when he was really acting as a spy. In the meantime,
the Byzantines could bring up reinforcements. It was
all right to forge letters showing that an enemy commander
was turning traitor and then arrange to have them fall into
his general’s hands. It was all right to disguise soldiers as innocent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
herdsmen driving bleating sheep and lowing cattle,
and have them lure the enemy into a prepared ambush. Obviously,
a feigned retreat was a recognized part of the game.
Even a real retreat did not disgrace a Byzantine general, although
the Byzantines were just as brave and proud as anyone
else. At least the general who retreated would have some
soldiers left and could fight and win another day.</p>

<p>The Byzantines also believed that if you wanted a good
army, you must pay it well and treat it even better. A general’s
salary could be as much as forty pounds of gold a year,
and even a recruit had cash in his pocket. When a soldier
served his time he might also get a grant of land. There was
a well-organized supply department, and the soldiers were
always sure of beans, cheese, and wine, to say nothing of what
they could plunder from the country. A special corps of engineers
pitched their tents for them and set up huge baths.
The soldiers were even allowed to have slaves and servants.
The army itself provided a groom for every four cavalrymen,
and every sixteen foot soldiers had an attendant who drove
a cart carrying all they needed. There was even an ambulance
corps of stretcher bearers and surgeons. The stretcher bearers
were paid a gold coin for every wounded man they brought
from the field.</p>

<p>This is what the Byzantine regular army was like, but besides
that, especially in the early days, there were regiments
or even whole tribes of Huns, Goths, Alans, and other barbarians
who fought for the emperor under their own chieftains.
Later on, particularly in Asia Minor, there were also the
great feudal lords, or Border Men.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful Byzantine poem called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Digenes Akrites</i>
about one of these men. Its hero is Basil Digenes Akrites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
son of an Arab emir named Monsour and a Greek lady of the
noble Dukas family. For this reason he is called Digenes Akrites,
which means “border man of two races.”</p>

<p>Basil was a valiant knight like Roland and Sir Lancelot, and
in spite of his Arab father, he was a faithful Christian. And so
when he wasn’t slaying lions, fighting cattle thieves, or rescuing
lovely damsels, he was ready to join forces with the emperor
and lead his men against the infidel.</p>

<p>But he only did this when he thought the emperor was
right! When one of the emperors came to visit his castle he
was quite willing to give him a lecture on how an emperor
should act.</p>

<p>Both the barbarians, with their hard-riding horsemen, and
the valiant border lords played an important part in defending
the Byzantine Empire from its enemies, but the Byzantines
never really trusted either group. A barbarian chieftain
was far too likely to ride off with his hordes and found a kingdom
of his own as Theodoric had done in Italy. A border lord
from Asia Minor was too likely to try to become emperor himself.
Indeed, more than one had.</p>

<p>The Byzantines also had a navy, one of the best navies of
the Middle Ages. But often they did not rely on it as they
did on their army. For one thing, the emperors were always
afraid of the navy for the same reason that they were afraid
of the border lords of Asia. They were fearful that some admiral
would use it to take their throne from them. Three admirals
did just that. Another reason was that the Byzantines
liked to be sure of what they were doing. But in those days,
ships were flimsy and the seas were full of unknown rocks and
sudden storms. The best of plans might be upset by the violence
of nature, and so it was more dependable to fight on
land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Just the same, when the Byzantines had to, they were always
able to get together a fleet, and it was usually a good
one. When Justinian sent an invasion army to North Africa, he
had enough ships to need 20,000 sailors. It was the navy that
twice drove the Arabs from Constantinople. In 853 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, the
Byzantines were able to send 300 ships against Egypt. A little
later, Zoe Black Eyes could order a veritable armada all the
way to Italy to drive Saracen sea raiders from their stronghold
near Naples. When the Byzantines attacked the pirates in
Crete, they were able to send 105 dromonds and 75 Pamphylians.
The dromond was the battleship of the Middle Ages.
It sometimes carried 300 men and was a bireme, that is, it
had two decks of oars on each side, one under the other. A
Pamphylian was a lighter, swifter cruiser. The admiral’s flagship
was usually a Pamphylian. There were also galleys; they
had only one bank of oars but were the swiftest of all.</p>

<p>It was the Byzantine navy that developed and used what
was probably the first “secret weapon” of all history. This was
the famous Greek fire. Even today nobody knows exactly
what it was, except that it was a complicated mixture of
chemicals, one of which may have been a crude form of
petroleum.</p>

<p>The Byzantines pumped it at the enemy through huge
tubes or hurled it at them from portable siphons almost like
modern flame throwers. Even water would not put it out. So
it was fairly easy to destroy an enemy fleet. Greek fire frightened
the enemy even more.</p>

<p>But the Byzantines did not rely only on the army or the
navy to win their battles for them. Helping them in every way
was the Byzantine diplomatic service. For just as the Byzantines
did not ever fight a battle if they could find some other
way of winning it, so too they didn’t even begin a war unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
they had to. Why fight if they could persuade an enemy to
become their friend and ally? Why fight, and risk their own
safety, if they could talk someone else into fighting for them?
To the Byzantines, this made sense.</p>

<p>It was up to their diplomatic service to do this, and the
reason it was able to do so very often was because here too
the Byzantines knew just what they were doing. Under the
Logothete of the Dromos, they had an almost modern intelligence
system taken care of by a special department whose
one job was to collect information about foreign nations.</p>

<p>How can such and such a country help the Byzantines and
how can it hurt them?</p>

<p>How can it best be won over by the Byzantines—by force,
by honors and favors, or by gifts?</p>

<p>If the last, by what kind of gifts?</p>

<p>Has it any enemies, and if so, who are they?</p>

<p>What were its origins? What is its history? What is its climate
and its geographical position?</p>

<p>Has it usually been a friend or an enemy of the Byzantines?
Trace this back to the day when it first appeared on the
scene!</p>

<p>With this information—the questions had been carefully
worked out by the emperor Constantine Born-in-the-Purple
in a book called <cite>How To Run the Empire</cite>—the Byzantines
could select the right method for the nation they were interested
in and then go to work on it.</p>

<p>If the ruler or his ambassador was easily dazzled, they
could impress him with court ceremony and with purple shoes
and robes, and they might even give out a title or two such
as patrician or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">archon</i>. They might even take some northern
duke or count and promote him to be prince or king provided
he swore allegiance to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>If he was greedy and avaricious—and, said Constantine,
“the tribes of the north demand everything and hanker after
everything”—they could give him cash in hand or even pay
an annual tribute.</p>

<p>As a last resort, the emperor could marry a foreign princess
or give a sister or a daughter in marriage to a foreign prince.
The Byzantines did not really approve of the latter, especially
the ladies who were shipped off to some outlandish country
without Byzantine comforts or conveniences! “I am being
sacrificed to the wild beast of the West!” wailed one of them.
But it often worked wonders. From distant Asbagia under
the towering snow-crowned Caucasus Mountains to distant
Germany, where the “wild beast of the West” lived, many
and many a kingdom was made friendly to the Byzantines
because a Byzantine princess sat on its throne.</p>

<p>But of course when an emperor did this, he must never give
the barbarians all they asked for, and he must always think
up a good reason for not doing so. If they asked for an imperial
crown or an imperial robe, he must point out that
these were sacred and consecrated and tell of the horrendous
death suffered by one emperor who had given some to his
Khazar relatives. If they asked for Greek fire, he must tell
them that it was given by an angel and that anyone who gave
it away would be struck down from heaven. If they sought
to marry a princess, he must tell them that the demand is
monstrous, even though the royal robe-makers were already
embroidering the wedding gown.</p>

<p>In that way he would not only save some of his valuable
possessions, but the barbarians would appreciate the ones
he did give them all the more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ONE_RELIGION">ONE RELIGION,<br>
ONE CHURCH</h2>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p class="no-indent">Last of the things that made the Byzantine Empire strong
and powerful was the Byzantine church. In some ways, it
was the most important of all.</p>

<p>The Byzantine Empire was much more than just one half
of the old Roman Empire dragging out its days for another
thousand years. It was a new Roman Empire based on Christianity.
Practically every Byzantine was a Christian, and so
it was Christianity that united all the many races and languages
into a single people. In spite of all the arguments
about this doctrine and that doctrine, practically every Byzantine
believed in the official Orthodox faith, and as the emperor
was head of this faith, that gave him additional power.</p>

<p>Even a weak emperor could point to the Bible. “Render
therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and
unto God the things that are God’s.” But the emperor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
<em>caesar</em>, and he was God’s representative too. He had to be
obeyed on both counts.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were by nature an intensely religious people.
They were Middle Easterners as well as Greek, and more
than half of the world’s great religions were born in the Middle
East—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, to name just the
most important three.</p>

<p>The Byzantines had been religious from the very beginning,
and the Greek side of their nature made them like to talk
and argue about their religion as well.</p>

<p>Saint Gregory of Nyssa visited Constantinople when it
was only forty years old, and even this holy man threw up
his hands in astonishment. The money changer who converted
his Asiatic money into Byzantine gold, the white-faced baker
who sold him a loaf of bread, even the slave boy who mixed
hot and cold water for him at the public bath, all wanted to
discuss the fine points of Christian beliefs with him.</p>

<p>Saint Gregory shook his head. “Everybody in this city seems
to be a doctor of theology,” he said. “<em>Everybody!</em> Even the
slaves and day laborers. There isn’t a man in the city who
can’t preach a good sermon, and they all do if you give them
half a chance. If you don’t believe me, just stand at any street
corner! Just go into any shop!”</p>

<p>But it was not merely the servants and shopkeepers who
were deeply wrapped up in religion. High or low, virtually
every Byzantine, even including those who spent most of
their time making money and amassing worldly goods, had
been taught from childhood and absolutely believed that
life in this world was a vain shadow and the important thing
was to win everlasting bliss in heaven. But this could only
be done through religion and the church.</p>

<p>That may have been why many rich Byzantines and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
many a Byzantine emperor or empress liked to endow monasteries,
just as in modern times many rich men set up foundations.
In fact, so many monasteries were set up in this way
that it became necessary to pass a law stating that if you
wanted to found a monastery, you must sell the land and
only give the money. Many of the greatest estates were being
left to the church and since they then didn’t have to pay taxes
any more, it grew more and more difficult for the state to raise
all the money it needed.</p>

<p>Many Byzantines, including emperors, became monks before
they died. They felt more sure of their reward in the
future if they actually entered a monastery, had their heads
shaven, and exchanged their golden garments for a hair shirt
or a cowl.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp73" id="70-71" style="max-width: 103.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/70-71.jpg" alt="Boy pointing and man talking">
</figure>
<br>

<p>That may also have been why so many patriarchs—the
title of the head of the Byzantine church—did not fear the
emperor, even though the emperor had appointed them.</p>

<p>One patriarch boldly told an emperor that no one had to
obey his laws if they went against the church. The emperor
exiled him but did not dare to harm him.</p>

<p>Another went even further.</p>

<p>“I made you emperor, you ignorant fool!” he shouted at
Isaac Comnenus. “I can bring you down as easily.”</p>

<p>He even put on the imperial purple shoes, saying the
patriarch had a right to wear them. Of course, he didn’t get
away with this, but at least he had tried.</p>

<p>Sometimes, to be sure, Byzantine religion was very close to
superstition, particularly among women and children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>You could make yourself a saint by becoming a stylite
like Saint Simeon Stylites, who lived most of his life on top of
a column sixty feet high without ever coming down. Simeon
was venerated and even prayed to.</p>

<p>Many Byzantines were certain that cures could be effected
by touching the arms, legs, and even the congealed sweat of
some holy man. On the other hand, a doctor was howled down
by the mob when he suggested ending a plague by letting
fresh air into the crowded tenements.</p>

<p>“Blasphemy!” cried the Byzantines. “God decides when
a man shall die, not fresh air!” When the doctor persisted, and
died himself, they said God had punished him.</p>

<p>Others believed that cities had been saved by the apparition
of some saint as much as by soldiers. For instance, when
the Goths stormed toward Thessalonica (modern Salonika),
the second city of the empire, Saint Demetrius appeared and
led the East Roman army to victory. When the Avars reached
Constantinople, the khagan saw a majestic female figure pacing
the walls. It was the Theotokos, the Greek word for
“Mother of God,” which the Byzantines called the Virgin
Mary. He turned back in panic.</p>

<p>Almost all the Byzantines paid great attention to fortunetelling,
palm reading, and prophecies. Everybody believed
in them. There were even more than a few emperors of
humble birth who would not have even dared to try seizing
the throne if it had not been for a fortuneteller or a prophecy.
But, although sometimes the monks and abbots themselves
told some of these fortunes, none of this had much to do with
the church.</p>

<p>The Byzantine, even the most superstitious Byzantine,
was truly Christian, but that did not mean he tolerated every
kind of Christianity in existence. The Byzantine did not believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
as most of us do, that religion is a personal matter and
that every man has a right to worship God in his own way,
according to his own conscience. To the Byzantine, there
was only one religion—the official religion. And there was
only one church—his own Orthodox Church. If you believed
anything else, you were a heretic and to be persecuted or
fought.</p>

<p>This had been so from the very beginning. Constantine
himself had called council after council to work out the
details of the Christian creed, and the emperors who followed
carried on his work. In council after council, they wrote down
in black and white what every Byzantine had to believe.
When it was written down, that was <em>it</em>. No further discussion
about it, unless you enjoyed exile or having insulting poetry
branded on your forehead; and this last really happened to
one poor monk who refused to conform.</p>

<p>It was still true in the last days of the empire, but by then
not even the emperor could change what had been agreed on
earlier. Some of the later emperors tried to. They journeyed to
France, Italy, and even England seeking help against the
Turks, and in order to get the Western nations on their side
they promised to make the Orthodox Church join the Roman
Catholic Church, with the Pope as head of both.</p>

<p>The Byzantine people rose in protest. Lucas Notaras,
a relative of the emperor and the last Megadux, or Great
Admiral, shouted at his cousin angrily. “Better a Turkish
turban than a papal miter!” he cried.</p>

<p>Although a huge Turkish cannon was already battering the
walls, the mob shouted its approval.</p>

<p>“The Latins are trying to destroy the Greek city, the Greek
religion, the Greek race, even the Greek language!” the
people roared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Even before there had been riots with the “democracy in
rags,” the poor people, joining the monks and abbots to make
certain that the old-time religion of the Byzantines was kept
true and pure even if this made the empire fall.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the old-time Orthodox Byzantine faith did not
come into being just as it was and all at once. Since religion
was so important, and since the Greeks loved to argue, the
whole history of the Byzantines is filled with violent discussions
and bitter differences of opinion about exactly what a
man was supposed to believe. Some of the arguments were so
complicated that it does not seem that the Byzantines themselves
always understood them, even though they were willing
to rush into the streets and fight about them. The arguments
are even more hard to understand today.</p>

<p>One of the most bitter disputes was about the use of the
single letter <em>i</em>. There is a Greek word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homoios</i> which means
“similar,” and another Greek word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homos</i> which means
“same.” Men and women were sent to distant sunless provinces
or shipped to lonely islands; they were locked in damp,
rat-infested cells; and volume after volume was written and
published over whether the Saviour was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homoi-ousion</i> (similar
to God) or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo-ousion</i> (the same as God). But this was
only one of many arguments and discussions. It would be impossible
to tell you even a small part of them. But that does not
mean that these differences were not important. Many people
think that the reason the Arabs conquered Egypt and Syria
so easily and converted the inhabitants to Islam was that
most of the emperors were Orthodox Christians who tried
to make the Egyptians and Syrians Orthodox, too.</p>

<p>The most important controversy that troubled the Byzantines
is easier to understand. It is called the Iconoclast (image<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
breaker) controversy, and it agitated the empire for more
than a hundred years.</p>

<p>Although the early Christians had opposed images and
paintings, calling them heathen idols, most Byzantines attached
great importance to them. In fact, some of their finest
art went into the making of statues, portraits, and even small
portable mosaics of saints, apostles, and other holy persons.
They called these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eikons</i>, and they certainly paid them great
reverence. Their enemies said they even worshiped them.</p>

<p>But not every Byzantine was an image worshiper. The
hardy mountaineers from Isauria and other parts of Asia
Minor still held to the Puritan-like thoughts of their ancestors.
They hated images. Then an Isaurian general seized the
throne. In addition to hating images, he realized that image
worship greatly increased the power of the monks and priests
who were now just about as strong as the emperor.</p>

<p>Because they hated images, and also to break the power
of the church party, he and his son and the other emperors
who followed ordered every image to be torn down and many
of them destroyed. Then they abolished many monasteries.
In some cases they made the monks and nuns parade hand
in hand before howling crowds in the Hippodrome, forcing
them to choose between marriage or torture and death.</p>

<p>These Iconoclast emperors were supported by the soldiers
(most of whom were also image breakers; and all wanted a
chance to loot church treasures) and by much of Asia Minor.
But the monks would not give in, many of them suffering
martyrdom first, and <em>they</em> were supported by the people;
by the superstitious sailors of the fleet; by all the women;
and by many of the empresses who were as stubborn as the
monks. Saint Theodora, for instance, although her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
was a strong Iconoclast, never gave up image worship in
private and she taught her daughters and granddaughters to
do the same. When she was surprised by a dwarf who told
the emperor, she said that the figures they were praying to
were really dolls and that she was playing with her grandchildren.
But later she had the dwarf beaten for good measure.</p>

<p>With opposition like that, the Iconoclasts could not hope
to win, and in the end they compromised. The images were
restored, but they were to be placed high and out of reach.
Worshipers could look at them or reverence them, but they
could not kiss them or touch them.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>It was at this time, and probably because harmony now
reigned, that the Byzantine church at last felt powerful
enough not only to take care of its own peoples’ religion, but
to set out to convert their heathen neighbors. Particularly their
Slavic neighbors! Many of these still worshiped pagan gods
800 years after Christ.</p>

<p>It was Michael the Drunkard, a much better emperor
than the name seems to indicate, who ended the Iconoclast
controversy. And it was the same Michael who sent out Saint
Cyril and Saint Methodius to do their work. They were the
most famous missionaries eastern Europe had ever seen.</p>

<p>They prepared themselves like generals going into battle,
and in a way they were like generals. They carefully restudied
the Slavic languages, for since they were from a part of the
empire where there were many Slavs, they already knew
some Slavic languages. They learned all about Slavic culture
and Slavic history. Finally they invented what is known today
as the Cyrillic alphabet, which is still used in much of the
Slavic world.</p>

<p>To be sure, their mission was not a complete success. They
converted Moravia, now a part of Czechoslovakia, without too
much difficulty, but when the Moravian king was defeated
by a German king the country became Roman Catholic.
Cyril and Methodius or saints trained by them, for they
actually trained saints, went into Bulgaria, Macedonia, and
Serbia. The people there stayed converted and stayed Orthodox.
Indeed, Bulgaria soon boasted that it was the “eldest
daughter of the eastern church,” and had its own patriarch,
and its own Santa Sophia, too.</p>

<p>But the most important conversion made by the Byzantines
took place a hundred years later. It was the conversion of the
Russians. The Russians themselves say this was done more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
by Byzantine splendor than by the talk of Byzantine missionaries,
or even by the marriage of the Russian Prince
Vladimir to the emperor’s sister, Anna.</p>

<p>In 989, this huge ruler with his forest-shaking voice decided
to make his people abandon their Norse gods and goddesses.
He sent ambassadors to the four great religions that
he knew about to find out which one was the best to adopt.</p>

<p>First the ambassadors went to the Black Bulgars, who were
Moslems. But the mosques were smelly and dirty, and the
Black Bulgars told the Russians that they would have to give
up wine.</p>

<p>“Drinking is the joy of the Russians!” roared Vladimir.</p>

<p>Next they visited the Jewish Khazars, but how, asked Vladimir,
could the Jews be God’s chosen people if he had scattered
them all over the earth?</p>

<p>Then they went to the German Roman Catholics.</p>

<p>“The Germans say that they worship the truth,” the ambassadors
reported, “but they have day after day of fasting,
and there is no magnificence.”</p>

<p>“I do not like to fast,” said Vladimir.</p>

<p>Finally, they visited the Greeks, that is, the Byzantines.</p>

<p>“The Greeks,” they said, “led us to the edifices where they
worship their God, and we knew not whether we were in
heaven or on earth, for nowhere have we seen such splendor
and beauty. We are at loss how to describe it, but we do know
that God must dwell there.”</p>

<p>Then they added, “If the Greek faith was not good, your
grandmother Olga would not have adopted it.”</p>

<p>For they knew that this straw-haired princess had never
stopped talking about the domes of polished copper, the
pavements of rare stone, the magnificent decorations, the
pearl-encrusted psalm books and Bibles, the incense and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the music in Constantinople. They knew too that she had
never stopped talking about the God-chosen emperor who
had wanted to marry her, and how she had tricked him into
giving her rich gifts instead.</p>

<p>Vladimir agreed. He ordered his subjects to be baptized,
and told his boyars to give up worshiping Odin and Thor,
and to burn their idols or cast them into the Dnepr River.</p>

<p>This conversion of the Slavs was as important to the Byzantines
as a victory by their army or by their diplomats, and
indeed it was a victory. For although they still fought with
the Serbs and with the Russians and particularly with the
Bulgarians, these people were gradually drawn into the Byzantine
way of life and became more and more friendly. Thus
the flanks of the empire were protected.</p>

<p>It was, of course, far more lasting than any military victory.
The Byzantine Empire came to an end more than 500 years
ago, but if you were to go into the Balkans or Greece today,
you would find that the work done by Saint Cyril and Saint
Methodius still remains. Even after forty years of communism,
you might find that the seeds of Christianity, and particularly
Greek Orthodox Christianity, which had been sown
by Vladimir’s conversion, were still living in some Russian
communist hearts.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It took a lot of money to be able to do all these things—to pay
the expenses of the emperor and his court and government,
and of the army, the navy, and the church, to say nothing
of bribing foreign rulers and their ambassadors. And this
money did not come from conquering fabulously rich lands
and then making them hand over their treasures as tribute
or as booty.</p>

<p>This method was the way the old Roman Empire had become
wealthy. In fact, the famous Roman statesman Cicero,
who had a rich province to govern, boasted to his friend
Atticus that the natives loved him because he did not make
them give him a well-furnished palace in every city where
he spent the night. They thronged from every village and
hamlet to cheer him because he did not force them to borrow
money and then pay him back with forty-eight per cent interest!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>But in Byzantine days there were very few fabulously rich
countries left to conquer, and the Byzantines had to find
some other source of wealth. They had to rely on hard work
and on their own skill and cleverness. They supported themselves
on the little farms that nestled in every Balkan valley
and the huge estates that sprawled over Thrace and Anatolia
(the Asiatic part of modern Turkey). They earned a living,
sometimes even amassing treasure, in the many industries
that were found in every Byzantine city. They became
wealthy from their world-wide foreign trade.</p>

<p>Nobody can say today just how wealthy they were. One
historian says that the Byzantine state had an annual budget
of one hundred and twenty million dollars in gold, but another
says that it was only twenty million.</p>

<p>No matter which was right, and it was probably the first,
you would still have to multiply the figure many times to find
out what it is worth in modern money. Anyway, this was
only the money spent by the government; it did not include
the vast sums and the enormous property owned by private
citizens. There may have been fifteen million people in the
Byzantine Empire, and while some of them were poor as
poor could be, a great many of them were very rich indeed.</p>

<p>Of all ways of making a living, farming probably came
first. Rich or poor, almost every Byzantine had an eye for
the land, that is, everyone except the city mobs who couldn’t
bear to be too far away from the excitement of the Circus.</p>

<p>In fact, many people say that the reason the Byzantine
Empire finally lost its wealth was because the average Byzantine
preferred to invest his money in an estate rather than in
foreign trade. The Byzantines let foreign trade fall into the
hands of the Venetians, Genoese, and Pisans. Then when
the Turks came and the richest provinces fell into the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
of the invaders, there was nothing to fall back on, and no
money to pay soldiers to hold the Turks off.</p>

<p>If that is so, it was for the same reason that the Byzantines
did not like the navy; foreign trade was too uncertain and
there was no way to figure out your risks. Just take pirates
alone. The Aegean Sea and in fact the whole eastern Mediterranean
was strewn with islands behind which lurked swift
ships, manned by swarthy corsairs. They were as dangerous
as Captain Kidd or Henry Morgan, and they kept Byzantine
traders terrified.</p>

<p>“What am I going to do?” jeered one of them, a Genoese, as
he boarded a heavily laden Byzantine merchant vessel.
“Seize you and your goods, <em>and cut off your noses</em>!”</p>

<p>But besides pirates, there was wind and weather, land robbers
(if you shipped your goods by caravan), and the possibility
that some prince or emir would confiscate your property
and say that it was indemnity owed to him by the Byzantine
Government.</p>

<p>And there was only the most primitive kind of insurance
to take care of you in time of trouble.</p>

<p>Of course, farming had its difficulties and dangers too. The
farmer was just as likely to have his crops ruined by drought
or by heavy rains as he is today. Also just as today, prices
were only high when there was little to sell. When the yield
was plentiful and the farmer’s storerooms were full, prices
went down and so even if you sold a lot, you didn’t get much
in return. There were also wild beasts to contend with. The
Balkans and Asia Minor were far more covered with waste
and woodland than they are now, and you did not have to go
to the steppes of Russia to find ravening wolf packs. No Byzantine
herdsman dared go out without a sheepdog as savage
as a wolf itself. Sheepdogs were so important that a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
who killed one was given 100 lashes and had to pay double
the dog’s value to its owner. Life was often hard for the Byzantine
farmer. We must never think of the world in those days
being like it is today. Boundary lines were not rigidly fixed
with customs officials at every point, and even when the Byzantine
Empire was strongest, savage bands and even nations
crossed the Danube and other rivers, roving to their hearts’
content. They never captured Constantinople, and the big
cities of the empire—from Thessalonica and Athens to Antioch
and Berytus (modern Beirut)—were often safe. But a
farmer who came back from his fields was just as likely to find
his farmhouse a smoking ruin and his wife and children murdered
or carried off, as a settler in our own wilderness days
was to find them scalped by Indians. The conditions were
about the same.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at least in most periods, and in a great many
parts of the empire, the Byzantine farmer did prosper and
was not only able to feed the empire but to ship some of his
surplus abroad as well.</p>

<p>This Byzantine farmer was very versatile. He grew wheat,
olives, every kind of fruit, and even flax and cotton. He maintained
herds of goats and sheep and cattle and horses. In his
“more or less self-governing” villages, there was not only uncleared
woodland, scrubby wastes, and unfenced pastures,
but vineyards and garden patches protected by deep ditches
and palisades of pointed stakes.</p>

<p>The very existence of a special farmer’s law shows how
important he was. This law took care of everything from
stealing or killing livestock to accidentally plowing someone
else’s land. The man who did this lost his crop and also the
time he had spent.</p>

<p>Another thing that shows how important the farmer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
to the Byzantine Empire is the size of a medium-sized farm:
100 yoke of oxen, 500 grazing oxen, 80 horses or mules, 12,000
sheep. That was what could be found on a typical farm!</p>

<p>Indeed, the main difficulties faced by the Byzantine farmer
were taxes, and the greediness of the big landowners. Taxes
were high and if one man did not pay them, the whole village
was responsible for his share. The greedy big landowner
caused even more trouble. Some of these “robbers in silk and
velvet,” as they were called, owned estates as big as provinces,
but even that did not satisfy them and they spent much of
their time trying to get the land of the neighboring small
farmers.</p>

<p>They tried all sorts of tricks and schemes. For instance, if
a small farmer was sick or in trouble, his rich neighbor would
offer to help him out if the farmer would adopt him as his
son. Then when the small farmer died, the rich farmer inherited
the land, and the small farmer’s wife and his real children
could beg or become farm hands or slaves. Finally, an emperor
who had been a small farmer himself made a law to protect
the small farmer. From then on the small farmer was not allowed
to give, sell, or even lease his land to a big farmer. But
this law did not last for long. The big farmer had too much
influence and had it repealed.</p>

<p>Next to farming in importance was Byzantine industry,
and in the long run this probably produced more wealth
than the Byzantine farmers did.</p>

<p>It was, of course, necessary to feed the huge city population,
and in spite of all the produce grown and raised on their
farms, the Byzantines still had to import some of the things
they needed. Wheat was one of them, and sometimes salt
fish, wine, and of course slaves.</p>

<p>It was also necessary to clothe the people, make shoes for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
them, butcher their meat, bake their bread, cask wine for
them, and build and furnish their houses. This kept many
hands busy.</p>

<p>But it was the luxury trades that brought the Byzantines
their fame and fortune. The goldsmiths made gold cups and
chalices, gold inlaid silver patens and plates, gold pectoral
crosses (the cross worn by a churchman upon his breast).
They also made jewelry and enamel that was so beautiful that
people still say that the finest and most exquisite craftsmanship
of the Middle Ages was Byzantine.</p>

<p>The glassmakers made their famous Byzantine glass. It
was noted for its rich color, and no other glass equaled it until
the Venetians began making glass on the neighboring island
of Murano in 1291. There was a special kind of Byzantine
glass called <em>fonde d’oro</em>. In this, designs of pure gold were
put between two layers of glass and then fused together.</p>

<p>The Byzantines also made and exported the finest kind
of china, ivory carved with figures of saints and emperors,
vases of honey-colored agate, lawn and other delicate cloth,
perfumes, strange and sharp-smelling mixtures of spices and
herbs, and too many other things to mention. These Byzantine
goods went all over the world. Byzantine products have
been found even in Scotland.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most important of all Byzantine industries
was the silk industry. Byzantine silks and heavy gold brocade
were not only needed throughout the empire for church
services and imperial functions. They, too, were widely
shipped abroad.</p>

<p>In the days of the old Roman Empire, all silk came from
China, where Roman ambassadors had traveled 1,000 years
before Marco Polo. The silk was carried by caravan across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the desert to Samarkand, and then to the Persian border,
where heavy duty had to be paid on it.</p>

<p>Silk still came from China—and there was still a heavy duty
on it—in the early days of the Byzantine Empire. But one day
while Justinian sat on his throne two Christian monks appeared
before him, one of them holding in his hand a hollow
bamboo. He broke it open, and inside were silkworm cocoons.
They had been smuggled all the way from distant Canton
or Nanking.</p>

<p>From then on, the Byzantines had a silk industry of their
own. The silkworm was cultivated all over the empire, but
especially in the Peloponnesus, the peninsula of southern
Greece, which now became known as the Morea—the Latin
word for mulberry leaf is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">morus</i>—from the mulberry trees
grown there for the silkworms to feed upon. Silk cloth was
woven all over the empire, but principally in Greece and at
Constantinople.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, some silk was even manufactured upon
the very grounds of the imperial Sacred Palace. This was a
special royal silk, and it was illegal to take any of it from the
empire.</p>

<p>Bishop Liutprand of Cremona—the same one who saw the
emperor magically lifted up into the air at the Magnaura
Palace—tried to smuggle some out of Constantinople, but he
was caught.</p>

<p>He tried to bluff his way through the customs by roaring,
“Your emperor Nicephorus came to his throne by lying and
crime! He told me I could buy all that I wanted to. Where is
the imperial promise?”</p>

<p>But although Liutprand was an ambassador from the German
emperor, the Byzantines merely smiled at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“You poverty-stricken Italians and Germans are not meant
to appear in such gorgeous material. Only we Byzantines,
who are unique in virtue, have a right to wear them.”</p>

<p>They forced him to open his baggage and took five of the
most splendid pieces. But they did pay him back the money
he had spent.</p>

<p>None of this Byzantine silk, and none of the other marvelous
things they made either, would have added very much to
Byzantine gold and glitter if the Byzantines had kept all for
themselves. Little as the average Byzantine liked to risk
his money in foreign adventures, it was foreign trade that
brought most of their wealth.</p>

<p>Byzantine foreign trade reached out all over the world.
The Byzantines imported animal skins, slaves, and sometimes
wheat from Russia; precious stones from India; spices from
Ceylon; embroidered rugs from Spain and Morocco; ores and
wrought metals from Italy and Germany; wool and woolen
goods from the Low Countries and England; hemp, flax, and
amber from the Balkans and the north. These were only a
few things they imported. Some of these things were shipped
out again; for instance, they shipped amber from the Baltic
to the Far East.</p>

<p>The Byzantines even penetrated darkest Africa. Not only
did they do business with the Ethiopian kingdom of Axum
on the Red Sea where the temperature sometimes went up
to 120°, but they may even have gone with the dark-skinned
Axumite merchants to the mysterious city of Zambabwe.
There, in the heart of the jungle, Negro tribesmen built towers,
walls, and palaces so mighty that even today men look at
the ruins and wonder how they did it.</p>

<p>Gold seemed to be as plentiful as pebbles in Zambabwe,
and you traded with the natives in the following way: You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
built a thick thorn breastwork, and on it you placed salt,
iron, and the carcasses of cattle. Then you went away, and
the natives slipped out of the forest and placed beans of gold
upon each object. Later on you came back and if you thought
they had left enough, you took the gold and the natives carried
off the meat and salt and iron. If not, you moved away
and the natives were given a chance to leave more gold.
Sometimes this bartering went on for four or five days. Neither
side saw, or even talked to, the other.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were able to carry on this world business,
because their principal city, Constantinople, had one of the
most strategic locations in the known world of that time.
It was like a spider in the center of a spider web; practically
every trade route in the world passed through it.</p>

<p>The Byzantines also had a large number of unusually fine
seaports in other parts of the empire. Besides Constantinople
itself, there was Smyrna, Thessalonica, Patras, and in the
early days, Alexandria. There were several others, many of
which are very good seaports even today.</p>

<p>The Byzantines also knew how to promote business. We
are apt to think of a world’s fair as something modern, but
the Byzantines knew all about them. Every year, in October,
they held an enormous trade fair on the Vardar plain outside
Thessalonica. There they built a huge temporary wood-and-canvas
city of booths and bazaars, and even amid the troubled
Middle Ages, merchants and peddlers flocked to it from all
over. It was only later, when the Byzantines became proud
and haughty, refusing to seek business while they sat on their
doorsteps waiting for business to come to them, that they got
into trouble. Then the energetic Venetians, Genoese, and Pisans
took over.</p>

<p>But nothing had more to do with making the Byzantines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
successful in world trade than the sound Byzantine money.
Their gold coin, known to us as the bezant, was one of the
four most widely accepted pieces of money the world has
ever known. The other three are the Florentine florin, which
made the Medici bankers so rich, the English pound sterling,
and now the United States dollar. Any one of these would
be accepted anywhere in the world during the time it was
in use.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="90-91" style="max-width: 94.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/90-91.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">GOLD BEZANT</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The reason the Byzantine coin was stable is that no one
ever tampered with the bezant. In the old days, kings used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
to clip their coins (that is, use a little less gold in them), but
no emperor ever clipped the bezant. It was always kept at
its full value.</p>

<p>An old Byzantine writer tells a story which shows both how
valuable the bezant was and how it traveled.</p>

<p>A Greek merchant was in Ceylon when he got into an argument
with a Persian merchant as to whose ruler was the more
powerful.</p>

<p>“Mine,” said the Persian. “He is King of Kings.”</p>

<p>“Why argue?” asked the Greek. “They are both in the room.
Compare them.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have some bezants, and you have some dirhams.
Put them beside each other.”</p>

<p>There was no need for further discussion. The portrait of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basileus</i> of the Romans was on the bezant, and the bezant
was the much more valuable coin.</p>

<p>I, myself, had an experience which proves the same thing.
On my desk in front of me is a real Byzantine gold piece. It
was coined in the reign of Basil I and his son Constantine,
and cannot be a day less than 1,090 years old. But I was able
to buy it at a price that I could afford. I asked the coin dealer
why.</p>

<p>“Bezants were used all over the world, and so you find them
everywhere!” he answered.</p>

<p>Because the Byzantine emperors made their gold coins so
stable in value that everybody wanted them, I am able to own
one today!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BYZANTINE">THE BYZANTINE<br>
WAY OF LIFE</h2>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div><br>

<p class="no-indent">What did the Byzantine Empire do for itself, and for the
world, and even for us, during the eleven long centuries when
it was almost always—but not <em>always</em>—so rich and powerful?</p>

<p>You would not really know about the Byzantines unless you
had the answer.</p>

<p>First of all, it defended a large part of the warm, civilized
Mediterranean lands from the Asiatic barbarians. The word
“Asiatic” is important, but maybe “barbarians from the Asiatic
steppes” would be better, for these were barbarians of
a special kind.</p>

<p>Our ancestors were barbarians, too, and the barbarians
that came from the forests of Germany and the sandy shores
of Denmark were capable of cruel destruction. But they were
also free and independent, with a gift for self-government
and an instinct that told them that one man has just as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
rights as another. They even elected their kings, cheering and
lifting them on their shields, and the kings they elected were
men like Theodoric of Italy, Alfred the Great, and Charlemagne,
all men who wanted to absorb the very best of the
civilization they had taken over, and not merely tear things
down.</p>

<p>If, instead of them, men like Attila and Genghis Khan, with
their hard-riding, slant-eyed followers, had become the rulers
of western Europe, iron discipline and a firm government
might have been established a whole lot sooner. But our democratic
way of living could never have been born. In other
words, the Byzantines defended Europe from the Asiatic
hordes and made it possible for Western civilization to develop
in its own way.</p>

<p>The Byzantines would hardly be worth remembering if
they had done nothing more than defend.</p>

<p>They also created a civilization of their own, and you can
still see its influence in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania,
and even Russia. And there are still traces of it all over
Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>If a Byzantine had come to life and looked at the coronation
of Elizabeth II of England over TV, he would have felt
perfectly at home, for in many ways it was a Byzantine
ceremony. The fact that this young woman was not only sovereign
of the realm but head of the official church was Byzantine,
too. She was following in the footsteps of the empresses
Irene and Zoe.</p>

<p>In the East, even the Turks who finally conquered the
Byzantines took over many of their ideas. In its early days
the Turkish Empire was very much like the Byzantine Empire,
except that it practiced Islam, the religion founded by
Mohammed. The Turkish <em>sanjaks</em>, or provinces, had almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
the same boundaries as the Byzantine <em>themes</em>, or provinces.
Their grand vizier, or prime minister—but there is a difference,
for the vizier’s name means “he who bears burdens,”
rather than “accountant”—was practically the same as the
Logothete of the Dromos. A Turkish <em>bey</em> was not too different
from a Byzantine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strategos</i>, or governor general.</p>

<p>The Turks even used Byzantines to help them rule. A large
number of the governors whom they sent out to their conquered
territories were Phanariote Greeks, those Greeks who
remained in Constantinople after the empire fell. All but
twelve of their forty-eight grand viziers were either Byzantines
or from former Byzantine provinces such as Albania,
Dalmatia, or Greece.</p>

<p>Byzantine civilization affected much more of daily life
than merely ceremonies and government, however. It entered
into every phase of life. It was the Byzantines who
invented the fork. From Constantinople it was taken to Italy,
and medieval English tourists brought it back to Britain.
But for a long time a man was considered sissy and affected
if he used one instead of his fingers.</p>

<p>High on the list of the great accomplishments of the Byzantines
is Byzantine art. In fact, many people think of it first,
and sometimes it is the only thing they think about when they
think of the Byzantines. Not long ago it was not very much
appreciated, but we now realize that it is one of the finest
arts there ever was. Besides that, it bridged the more than
thousand-year gap in art between the wonderful statues of
the Greeks and Romans and the oil paintings and frescoes
of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="96-97" style="max-width: 84.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/96-97.jpg" alt="Two men painting">
</figure>
<br>

<p>The most famous Byzantine art is the Byzantine mosaics.
A Byzantine mosaic is a picture made of little pieces of glass
and gold and precious stones. These mosaics were usually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>very large and set right into the walls of churches, and so it
is almost impossible to see one unless you visit the church
itself. You would have to go at least to Italy where there are
some very fine ones in Rome, Ravenna, and Naples. These
Byzantine mosaics are quite stiff, and the people in them
usually look straight ahead. But if you ever see a real one,
or even a good picture of one, you will never forget it.</p>

<p>The Byzantines also did oil paintings and frescoes, particularly
in their later days and particularly in the Balkans and
Greece. There are frescoes in Yugoslavia and in southern
Greece that are almost as good as those of the great Italian
artist Giotto, and they were done 200 years before him. Byzantine
sculpture ranged from richly carved marble, like
the big throne of a patriarch in Ravenna, to ivory caskets
and plaques. Byzantine illuminated manuscripts are also
among the most beautiful ever made. Most of them are Bibles
and other religious books, but there are several about the
travels of Cosmas Who-Sailed-to-India. They are filled with
saints in blue and scarlet, and one manuscript has a picture
of a boatload of escaping martyrs showing what travel was
like in Byzantine days.</p>

<p>Byzantine art is not only wonderful itself, but it shows
how the Byzantines helped themselves to everything good
that had been done before them. On the walls of a famous
tomb in Ravenna, there is a mosaic of two doves at a drinking
fountain that might have come from the ancient Roman
city of Pompeii. There is also Byzantine art that bubbles
over with Greek love of life. Some of it is filled with early
Christian saints and symbols, like the peacock and the fish.
There is some with the lions and eagles of the ancient Hittites,
and others whose fierce, bearded saints are like Assyrian
warriors. But, of course, this practice of blending the ideas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
of different peoples wasn’t limited to art. It applied to everything
the Byzantines did.</p>

<p>The Byzantines preserved classic culture. They preserved
Greek literature, Greek science, Greek learning, and even the
Greek language. And this at a time when almost everybody
in the West had completely forgotten Greek, and as a matter
of fact, only churchmen and a handful of ragged scholars
even knew Latin.</p>

<p>This was a very important contribution. No civilization
ever starts from scratch, and our modern one is based on the
renewed interest in classic culture that is called the Revival
of Learning. During that time, great writers like Petrarch and
Boccaccio were willing to spend a fortune to get the services
of some bearded ruffian who could teach them Greek. When
Constantinople fell, the Byzantine scholars who escaped to
Europe could sell any manuscript they brought with them
for enough money to live on for a long time.</p>

<p>The Byzantines never had to rediscover Homer, or Plato,
or Euclid, who invented geometry, or Eratosthenes, who
knew the world was round 1,700 years before Columbus, even
measuring its circumference as 25,000 miles, which is almost
right. They never had to rediscover the ancients; they knew
about them all the time.</p>

<p>Another thing the Byzantines did was to insist on education.
Even the mighty French emperor Charlemagne had a
hard time if he wanted to spell his way through a book and
sign his name. Most Byzantine emperors could not only read
and write but were thoroughly educated. Theophilus studied
everything from Greek to natural history. Leo the Philosopher
composed poems, sermons, and a life of his father. Constantine
Born-in-the-Purple was famous for his books on the barbarians
and on his empire. John IV and Manuel II, and above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
all Anna Comnena, a princess, wrote astonishingly good
histories.</p>

<p>It was not merely the emperors and some of their courtiers
who were learned. Although a few poor men—like the saint
from Asia Minor who had to tend his father’s swine and did
not learn to read until he was forty-seven—did not have the
chance to be educated, most Byzantines went to school or a
university from the time they were five until they were twenty.</p>

<p>If you had been a Byzantine, you would have trotted off
to your classes accompanied by a pedagogue—in the old
days, he was a slave—who carried your books and saw to it
that you obeyed your teachers. Until you were ten, you
would have studied reading, writing, and spelling. The last
was very important because the way words were pronounced
was always changing, although the spelling remained the
same. After this you would have studied what the Byzantines
called grammar. But it was not exactly like our grammar. It
was more like literature. For instance, you would have had
to learn Homer by heart and been able to explain everything
he had written word by word. You were in trouble if you
weren’t able to do this. The teacher merely nodded to the
pedagogue, who always had a rod in his hand. After grammar,
you would have studied rhetoric, and to pass your
rhetoric courses you had to be able to discuss eloquently anything
from a fable by Aesop to the pictures on the walls of the
city council. Finally, and this was especially important if
you were going to be a churchman or go into the government,
you would have gone on to a university. That was the case
only if you were a boy. Although many Byzantine women were
as well educated as the men, everything they learned was in
the home. None of them went to college or even to grammar
school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>Besides giving us great art, keeping alive Greek culture and
civilization, and seeing to it that there was at least one place
in the world where everyone who wanted to be was educated,
the Byzantines protected and preserved the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Long before the word “crusader” was ever heard, the
Byzantine emperor Heraclius was fighting the Saracens in
Damascus, Homs, Jerusalem, and Antioch just as the crusaders
did in the days of Richard the Lion-Hearted 500 years
later. Almost every Byzantine emperor who followed him did
the same. Among the caliphs whom they fought, but could
not defeat, was Harun al-Rashid, the hero of <em>The Arabian
Nights</em>.</p>

<p>They did defeat many another Moslem leader, however,
and so although the Arabs often advanced through the empire,
they were never able to pour into the Balkans as they
had poured into France and Spain.</p>

<p>But the Byzantines did more than just battle the enemies
of Christianity, and they also did more than argue over the
fine points of religion.</p>

<p>They tried to practice Christianity as well as preach it.
They believed that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">philanthropia</i>—from which our word
“philanthropy,” or “love of mankind” is derived—was the first
duty of those who were rich or had power. There were no
people before the Byzantines, and only a few since, who believed
so sincerely that every man was really and truly his
brother’s keeper. And by being his brother’s keeper they
meant taking care of him in every kind of need.</p>

<p>In the Byzantine Empire there were homes for travelers
and pilgrims. There were homes for orphans. There were
homes for the sick. There were homes for foundlings. There
were old-age homes.</p>

<p>All of these institutions were heavily endowed when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
were not actually supported by the government, and the
officials in charge of them were important people. Take the
orphan homes, for example. There were forty orphan homes in
Constantinople alone. Each was headed by an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">orphanotrope</i>.
The Grand Orphanotrope who was over all of them, was appointed
by the emperor himself. He held one of the highest
offices in the empire.</p>

<p>Many of the Byzantine laws were Christian as well. In
the old days of the ancient Roman Empire, the father was
the absolute master of the family. His wife’s property, including
her dowry, became his, and if he did not like her,
he could divorce her with little more than a word. At least
in the very early days, he had power of life and death over
his slaves and almost as much over his children. If a son did
not please him, he did not have to leave him a penny in his
will.</p>

<p>But the Byzantines did not want laws like that. They
wanted laws that the Saviour would approve of. In their
opinion, Christ would not have approved of divorce, and so
although they could not stop it altogether, they made it much
more difficult to get. At one time there were only four recognized
reasons for divorce. One of them was that you could
get a divorce if your husband (or wife) tried to murder you!</p>

<p>Women were given many other rights by the Byzantines. If
a child wanted to marry, he had to get his mother’s permission
as well as his father’s. A woman’s property did not
belong exclusively to her husband; her property and her husband’s
property now belonged to both of them. If the father
died, the mother could become her child’s guardian.</p>

<p>The child also got some new advantages. If you got a job
in the old Roman days, your earnings went to your father.
Under the Byzantines, you could keep them yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>Slaves also had to be treated with justice. Under Christianity,
even the most wretched slave was a human being with a
soul which he could lose or save. He was no longer cattle, and
his master could not slay him at will. He could not even treat
him inhumanely.</p>

<p>Even the laws about business were based on the idea that
the good of everybody was more important than the good of
any individual. In fact, the Byzantines had an almost socialistic
control of everything and everybody that made money.</p>

<p>Every branch of Byzantine industry was organized into
corporations or guilds, and these corporations had the right to
fix prices and wages down to the last penny. They had the
right to decide who could go into a trade or business. They
had the right to decide the exact place where a shop or booth
or factory could be set up; for example, no shop selling wax
and candles could be less than seventy yards from another
candle shop. They also had the right to decide what goods
could be imported, and what kind of goods, and in what
amounts, could be shipped abroad.</p>

<p>But even at that, the corporations did not have absolute
control of everything, for over them was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eparch</i>, or lord
mayor, and over the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eparch</i> was the emperor.</p>

<p>The emperor was supposed to be for all of the people and
not for any group of them, and the emperor had the last word.</p>

<p>In spite of all they accomplished and their charitable principles
and humane ideas, the Byzantines also had faults, however.
There was a black side to their civilization just as there
was a bright side, and some of it was very black indeed.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were very cruel. They were Greek, but
they were also Oriental, and had in them a ferocious streak
that not only was indifferent to suffering but seemed to take a
fiendish pleasure in it. Most mobs are savage, but the Byzantine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
mob was even more savage than usual. Only the mobs of
the French Revolution can compare with it.</p>

<p>For instance, when the Byzantines overthrew the emperor
Andronicus, they were not satisfied with just tossing him from
his throne. A howling crowd of men and women tore out his
beard, broke his teeth, beat him, and dragged him through
the streets at the tail of a mangy camel while shouting fearful
curses at him. He was seventy years old, but although he
begged to be put out of his misery, it was many hours before a
soldier who was not one of the crowd took pity on him and
killed him.</p>

<p>He was by no means the only emperor who died cruelly. As
a matter of fact, it was a very rare thing for an emperor to die
peacefully in his bed. Usurpers and would-be emperors were
often treated just as savagely as Andronicus had been.</p>

<p>Byzantine laws could be cruel, too, although their cruelty
was in the name of Christianity and mercy. The Byzantines
thought it was against the teachings of Christ to condemn a
man to death, and so the death penalty was rare. Instead, a
criminal was mutilated; they tore out his tongue or cut off his
nose or a hand. Blinding was a common punishment. The
Byzantines actually thought it was merciful to blind a man
instead of executing him.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were treacherous, and, in fact, “Byzantine
treachery” became a well-known saying. Probably they were
not as treacherous as their enemies said they were, and their
enemies, including the crusaders, were also treacherous. But
in everyday life just as when they went to war, the Byzantines
were always ready to plot, trick, deceive, and lie. When they
did tell the truth, it was usually because honesty happened to
be the best policy, and not because they thought that honesty
was the only right thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>The emperors often gained the throne by trickery. Michael
the Drunkard made Basil I his co-emperor in the kingdom
because Basil had deceived him into thinking that Michael’s
uncle, the <em>Caesar</em> Bardas, was a traitor. <em>Caesar</em> Bardas was
executed. Then Basil waited until Michael was asleep, and
had him murdered.</p>

<p>Michael’s grandfather, Michael the Stutterer, had come to
the throne in the same way. As a matter of fact, he was in
prison when he succeeded in outwitting a boyhood companion
who was then the emperor. He actually still had chains
on his wrists and ankles when he was crowned.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were corrupt and prospered on graft. Although
most of this graft and corruption centered around the
imperial court, business and the church were often corrupt.
In all three of these places, you got ahead by giving—and
receiving—favors.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were high-strung, excitable, and fiery.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were very fond of luxury whether in dress,
food, jewelry, furniture, or even horses and chariots.</p>

<p>They craved entertainment. One emperor even told his
signalmen not to light the beacons that carried news of an
approaching enemy from hill to hill until it reached Constantinople.
He was afraid it would cast gloom upon the horse
races.</p>

<p>The Byzantines were much too fond of pleasure.</p>

<p>Even so, when you add the pluses and subtract the minuses
for the Byzantines, it turns out that you have something
pretty good, particularly for those troubled times.</p>

<p>Besides, not all the Byzantines were unprincipled and evil.
The mob at the bottom and the courtiers and noblemen on
top had glaring defects, but the middle-class Byzantines, of
whom there were more than any other group, were often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
brave, high-spirited, and loyal; and they were always intelligent.
The Byzantine father was steady and hard-working, and
the mother sincerely pious and devoted to her children. Their
life was sometimes hard, but it was often happy. And there
always was a chance for self-respect.</p>

THE EMPIRE</h2>

<br>

<p class="no-indent">Geoffrey of Villehardouin and Robert of Clari—the two
writer-crusaders—were among the last people to see Constantinople
in all its glory, and even they were not able to walk
through streets filled with magnificence for very long.</p>

<p>The knights and barons of the Fourth Crusade had promised
to put the young Alexius on the throne. This they did,
and for good measure they put his old blinded father back
on the throne beside him too. They let the rulers wear the
imperial purple shoes and the glittering brocaded robes, pretending
to have restored the imperial power. Alexius and his
father could indeed wield the scepter and wear the crown and
be absolute monarchs, provided they did everything the crusaders
told them to.</p>

<p>In return, the young Alexius had promised to pay the crusaders
200,000 marks of silver, to lead an army to the Holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Land with them, and to maintain and equip 500 of their
knights in armor for as long as he lived.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="108-109" style="max-width: 97.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/108-109.jpg" alt="Men pulling horse statue">
</figure>
<br>

<p>This, however, was another matter, and when the two emperors
made even a half-hearted attempt to live up to their
promises, the Byzantines revolted. Another Alexius—Alexius
Bushy Eyebrows—was made emperor and he made it known
that the Venetians and the crusaders could whistle for their
money. Not a single copper coin, let alone 200,000 silver ones,
would they ever get from him!</p>

<p>This gave the crusaders the chance they had long been
waiting for and probably planning for, and they didn’t waste
any time in taking it. Proclaiming Bushy Eyebrows, as they
called him, a traitor and a caitiff villain, they attacked the city
with ships, ladders, and men-at-arms. On April 13, 1204,
after five days of desperate fighting, they burst into it. There
for three days and nights, the Christian soldiers—wearing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
cross upon their shoulders—burned, robbed, and murdered
the Christian Byzantines.</p>

<p>“Even the followers of Mahound, the false prophet, were
more merciful when they took Jerusalem!” cried a Byzantine.</p>

<p>He was right. Little like it has ever happened anywhere
else, except during the invasions of Attila the Hun. Constantinople
has never been the same since.</p>

<p>The robbery was even more wholesale than the slaying.
Churches, private homes, and palaces were stripped to their
bare stone walls, and then all that was not hidden by private
looters was piled where it could be seen and divided.</p>

<p>“The booty was so great that no one could tell you of it,”
said Villehardouin.</p>

<p>It included gold and silver; vessels and precious stones;
silk and samite; robes of vair and robes of ermine; rare and
irreplaceable books; icons; beautiful carved chests; and, of
course, all the coinage in the treasury. In fact, everything that
was not too heavy to move.</p>

<p>The Venetians were immediately paid the 50,000 marks
reckoned to be their share. Even after that, not counting
what had been stolen and hidden, there may have been
400,000 silver marks’ worth of rare prizes. To say nothing—and
there was no knight who didn’t want one—of 10,000 fiery
steeds!</p>

<p>There was no one who was too lofty or too pious to take
his share of this booty. The abbots and the warrior-bishops
laid their hands on every holy relic they could find. Most of
these went to France, where they disappeared during the
French Revolution. The doge took the four famous bronze
horses of the Hippodrome, and even today the Venetians
point to them on the façade of the church of Saint Mark just
as proudly as if they had not helped themselves to them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
There was hardly a knight who did not wear rich fur-trimmed
robes. There was hardly a common foot soldier or even a
jackallike camp follower who did not have a fat purse, and a
heavy chain of gold to boot. The proud Byzantines returned
to ruined churches and to charred and plundered houses.
Fabled Byzantium had become an empty shell.</p>

<p>The Byzantine Empire became an empty shell too. The
crusaders captured the new emperor and made him jump
from the top of one of the tall marble columns. Then, after a
lot of bickering, they elected one of their own number to succeed
him. There was an empire, but it was now a Latin empire
and no one but the crusaders recognized it. Even they
did not leave it all its territory. Venice took over a third of
Constantinople and most of the Byzantine islands in the
Aegean and Ionian seas. Every knight or baron who wanted
it was given a fief or a principality in southern Greece. Besides
that, three Byzantine “governments in exile,” each
claiming to be the real one, sprang into being. One was at
Trebizond near the eastern end of the Black Sea. One was in
Epirus, which is more or less the same as modern Albania.
The third and most important was at Nicaea, which was just
across the straights in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>So for fifty-seven years, there was not one Byzantine Empire,
but four of them, plus half a dozen other small states
that all squabbled with each other. Then, in 1261, Michael
Paleologus, a great-grandson of one of the old emperors recaptured
Constantinople and put on the imperial crown.</p>

<p>But although there was only one Byzantine Empire again,
it was little more than a shadow. Nor could any of the nine
Byzantine emperors who followed Michael restore the old-time
glory. The crusaders had done too good a job. Constantinople
was now too poor and shabby. Its trade was gone. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
famous bazaars were filthy, and their booths were empty of
wares. Most of the population had moved away. Even the
emperors themselves lived hand to mouth. Although they
tried to keep up the ancient ceremony, they couldn’t do it. At
the wedding of a daughter of one of the emperors, the guests
had to eat off earthenware plates.</p>

<p>Besides that, and probably because of it, anarchy reigned
during the 200 years that the empire somehow lingered drearily
on. Mercenary bands moved about the countryside robbing
and stealing, instead of fighting for the emperor. They
even moved on Constantinople when they weren’t paid, or
thought they were not paid enough.</p>

<p>The Byzantines also had to fight off outside enemies. The
Bulgarians renewed their old-time warfare and nibbled away
at the shrinking empire. A great Serbian king proclaimed
himself Roman emperor as well as Serbian monarch. He almost
succeeded. The Byzantines had to fight the Genoese,
and sometimes the Venetians, and even the Frank barons,
descendants of the crusaders.</p>

<p>Finally the Ottoman Turks appeared upon the scene, and
that was the last blow. These wonderful fighters conquered
all of Anatolia and then step by step they worked their way
into Europe. It was not long before the Byzantine Empire was
only Constantinople itself with a few square miles of the surrounding
countryside. The Byzantines soon couldn’t even
raise an army without Turkish permission, and usually that
permission wasn’t granted.</p>

<p>In 1453, which is one of the famous dates in history, even
that much freedom seemed too much to the Turks, and their
young ambitious sultan, Mohammed II, decided to take the
city. Slowly and carefully he laid plans to do so.</p>

<p>First he built one tower here and another there, ringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
the city and cutting off escape from it. Then he brought up
a mighty navy of 493 ships, and a great army of 200,000 men.
It was the first army in history to be equipped with siege
guns, and one of these was so big it took 100 oxen to drag it.
Mohammed, too, was so determined to take Constantinople
that when his ships could not break through the iron chain
the Byzantines had laid across the Golden Horn, he had a
whole fleet of them dragged overland, with the crew still sitting
at the oars—and all this in a single night.</p>

<p>What could the Byzantines do against all this power? They
had only 8,000 soldiers, and many of these were monks and
untrained citizens. To be sure, they were led by two heroes,
one an Italian mercenary, the other the last Byzantine emperor,
Constantine XI. Both of them heroically lost their lives
in the battle to defend Constantinople.</p>

<p>But heroism was not enough, and the city’s walls, mighty
as they were, could be smashed by cannon balls. After a
month of siege the howling Janizaries entered it. Once again,
Constantinople was sacked and looted, and although the
Turks were not nearly so ruthless as the crusaders had been,
this time it did not rise again.</p>

<p>The empire did not rise again either. On May 29, 1453,
Constantinople, which had once been Byzantium, became Istanbul.
It has been Istanbul ever Since.</p>

<p>On that day, the Byzantine Empire ended too.</p>

<p>For more than a thousand years, it had carried the torch of
Western civilization, a torch that had been given to it by the
Greeks and Romans. Now, new nations took up the burden.
Spain, France, and England had become united and powerful.
Italy was filled with all the wonderful art and thought
and writing and wealth that came with the Italian Renaissance.
Germany was stirring with new ideas. Even in distant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>Poland, Copernicus would soon be looking through his telescope
and teaching us that the sun did not revolve around
the earth, but rather that the planets revolve around the sun.
In only forty years Columbus would discover America.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>So their job became our job, and it still is. They were not
perfect, but let us hope that we do it as well as they did. Let
us hope that our civilization lasts as long.</p>

</div>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Thomas Caldecot Chubb</span>, internationally known author,
scholar, and literary critic began his writing career while
still a student at Yale with the publication of two books,
one of which won him the Albert Stanborough Cook
award for poetry, and a poem which won him the John
Masefield Award. Since that time he has published a
number of books which are outstanding for both scholarship
and writing—among these his well-known biography
<cite>Aretino: Scourge of Princes</cite>. Mr. Chubb’s interest in the
Byzantines, awakened during his college days, has continued
throughout his life. <cite>The Byzantines</cite>, his first book
for young people, reflects his intimate knowledge of the
subject.</p>

<p class="no-indent">World traveler, sportsman, and civic leader, Mr. Chubb
lives in Greenwich, Connecticut, with his wife and their
three teen-age children.
